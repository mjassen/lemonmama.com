And this match lasts maybe 2m30s. and the one is seems more skilled/stronger etc. than the other. about 3 takedowns. and then pinning/northsouth/side control. and the one wins seemingly by arm bar.</p><p class="P1">note: pretty inspiring. a different feel even from the previous match, yet some similarities (as between any two bjj fights)</p><p class="P1">note: ok but unelated other note. this is a tournament. in the background there is another whole fight going on. looks like some tween/teen females. and i can see the one girl is trying to break the other girl's guard and the one is picking the other up off the ground in order to try to do so. lol just like we practiced a couple times in class, nice. and so my bjj lessons do cross over with this match too.</p><p class="P1">and not only that. each match has its own separate referee.</p><p class="P1">the mat 5 referee is this big guy with glasses and with a gut. and he looks like he is just a guy who probably works during the week and refs his kids/ community jiu-jitsu matches on the weekends/nights. nice.</p><p class="P1">And but this mat 5 ref, and the other mat ref, note is that they are all both very diligent, they keep a constant eye on the kids they are reffing. and they are poking and checking to see if any kid is in danger or not. and they are ready to adjust or stop the fight if needed. so this referee aspect is inspiring to me too. beause the kids are depending on the refs to run the fight and to be fair and to keep them safe. and the refs are doing just that. nice.</p><p class="P1">note: 2x fights (3x including the bg one) now. I see a lot of these people are white brazilian folks. I can hear many people all talking portugese in the background. huh. also, so far all the contestants have brazilian sounding names/spellings. huh.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P1">match 3 ended. within 45s. or so. kid won by armbar.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">match 4 ended. within 30s. or so. kid 1 won by armbar. kid 2 is crying a bit. again i discern its mostly because he lost / lost-quickly. this is fascinating. it actually reminds me of when i was a kid when i failed at something, then i cried like that. wow. it brings me back.</p><p class="P1">also a tiny bit it reminds me of these days recently when i get pounded beaten pretty badly rolling/wrestling at training at brazilian jiu-jitsu training. except it again reminds me. these kids are rolling harder (much harder) than i usually have been. because i usually am off of my conditioning or i am nursing an injury or else i am just skipping practice.</p><p class="P1">so my note to my self is how can i get my conditioning up and get my attendance up, so i can even get to the level to be able to EVEN FAIL AS MUCH AS THESE KIDS ARE FAILING. because guess what in order to fail properly, one has to first be able to try properly.</p><p class="P1">wow.</p><p class="P1">inspiring in this aspect too.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">47m. mark paused.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">intermission note: i realized now suddenly. I like watching ADCC more, or at least more in a differently sense, than watching ("UFC") NOR ("fight to win"). because here's why. UFC is total elite professionals. its not that realistic for me because its so ultra high-level. inspiring but not as realistic for me. and why for Fight To Win (on flograppling) is that that also tries to copy UFC a bit. it's pretty good though. and  Fight to Win does have good commentators sometimes(like that chicago one). However. it is trying to be, and actually a bit is, more elite. and it seems hyped so much in many ways. Like Fight To Win is a single ring and one fight at a time, they play hype music+video, and dim the lights. It's like they're spending a lot of time/money on the production. etc. etc.</p><p class="P1">So finally we come to the reason why I like these smaller regional ADCC tournaments. They are like 6 mats at a time simultaneously rolling, each mat with a referee, all well lit, in like a big college gymnasium, and with all the families/spectators sitting on bleachers in the background, and, the referee trys to keep things moving and starts the fights promptly/quickly with no fuss, and ends the fight properly/quickly with just simple arm-raises and simple handshakes. and then there is awkward dead video on the bright empty mat in between matches where obviously the contenstants/refs/coaches/teams are scrambling to get on the mat. VERY REALISTIC. i like.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">See also:</p><p class="P1">#0181 - Review: Watching FloGrappling (Fight to Win 292)</p><p class="P1"><a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2026/0181%20mo%20watches%20flograppling.html" class="Internet_20_link">https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2026/0181%20mo%20watches%20flograppling.html</a></p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">47m. mark.</p><p class="P1">next fight starts. its older females, seems like tween/teen.</p><p class="P1">wow. spoiler alert. the one girl becomes injured in the first 20s. or so. seems accidental. either her nose or ear or neck areas.</p><p class="P1">the ref sees this and stops the fight diligently quickly.</p><p class="P1">medics are called and 3 medics come to tend her. wow.</p><p class="P1">mo note: neither girl seems mad nor terribly upset. just the one does act truly hurt. and the other seems respectful and concerned.</p><p class="P1">so but now the video footage is just awkward of the stopped fight and the girls and the medics and the referee walking around and tending to the situation and/or standing still.</p><p class="P1">whoah: mo note: then the referee ultimately judges the other girl (the uninjured one) to be the winner! lol i shouldn't laugh. but i can just observe and guess. that part of the win reason was the other girl didn't get accidentally injured and the one girl did get accidentally injured.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">53m. mark paused.</p><p class="P1">In other words, all that I wrote above, happened in the first 53 minutes of the video. nice.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"/><p class="P1">In conclusion, If you want to see some real Jiu-Jitsu and some real human drama, then I do recommend you to watch this video.
