<h2>Looking For A Job With PepsiCo - It's Pronounced “PEPS-uh-co”</h2>
This is a story, across 6 days, researching "Pepsee-Coh" while I look for a job.

This is early in the story so you notice I'm still caling the commpany "Pepsee-Coh". More on this later.

My job search strategy is to pick a specific company, a specific job role, and do a deep dive researching it. While also applying to similar roles at similar companies as well.


--- Day 1.

On Day 1, researching "Pepsee-Coh", and I read the company's 2021 Annual Report, and I learn interesting things. Here are just a few:

- New York HQ.

- Walmart channel is 11% of sales.

- "Pepsee-Coh" is selling "yummy taste". (my words)

"2021 Annual Report" for PepsiCo
<a href="https://www.pepsico.com/docs/default-source/annual-reports/2021-annual-report.pdf?sfvrsn=e04eec5e_0">https://www.pepsico.com/docs/default-source/annual-reports/2021-annual-report.pdf?sfvrsn=e04eec5e_0</a>

--- Day 2.

On day 2, I start seeing 'Pepsee-Coh' brands EVERYWHERE in my daily life. 

I. See. 'Pepsee-Coh'. Trucks. Everywhere. Doritos. Fritos. Pepsi. Gatorade. Delivery trucks 10 times per day when I'm driving around town.

Today is Superbowl Sunday. I see the ads for Pepsi Zero, featuring Ben Stiller and Steve Martin. I see the Doritos ad featuring Jack Harlow.
I realize that 'Pepsee-Coh' is really making an effort to appeal to Superbowl fans.

Inside a nearby Dunkin cafe, I notice the drinks case is being replaced today, and it ONLY has 'Pepsee-Coh' brands in it. Only. Gatorade. Tropicana. Pepsi. Aquafina. And so on.
I realize certain establishments want to only work only with one drink vendor.

At a nearby Market Basket supermarket, I saw a new drink called "Starry" on the endcap. I look at the label, turns out it's a new soda brand product from, you guessed it, 'Pepsee-Coh'.

As they say on the 'Pepsee-Coh' "Flipping the Fair" podcast (more about that later), it takes a lot of work to get those products on those shelves of those stores!
And I'm starting to become tuned in to that.


--- Day 3.

I start digging on LinkedIn profiles for 'Pepsee-Coh' folks.

I'm also still calling the company 'Pepsee-Coh'. I promise more on this later.

I see "Pepsee-Coh" employees on LinkedIn, sharing how they worked on superbowl promotion or on launching "Starry" brand. nice.

I see someone from Sodastream got promoted from within the company. nice.

But it's not all sunshine and daisies on social media for "Pepsee-Coh".

On Twitter I see folks bashing 'Pepsee-coh' on Twitter for non transparency on cage-free chickens humane animal issues. 
I don't know the details of this, but, I do see this as an example of the delicate balance betwen a corporation and the public.


--- Day 4.

I head over to the Pepsi Careers website.

I find this podcast I mentioned earlier, the "Flipping the Fair" podcast. This is a short podcast series aimed at prospective 'Pepsee-Coh' employees.

And in the first 5 minutes of the first episode, by listening, I learned that, it's pronounced “PEPS-uh-co” (PEPS-əco).

I'm glad that now I learned how to properly pronounce the company name!


--- Day 5.

I dig into listening to the "Fliping the Fair" podcast, and start researching local Massachusetts PepsiCo Job ads too.

On this podcast I heard the story of "Atticus", who is a 'sales district leader' with PepsiCo.
And he tells how it's his '...job to make sure the products get from our warehouse, to the store, and then into the hands of the customer. ...'

Podcast: 'PepsiCo Flipping the Fair: The Career Fair, Reinvented'
Episode: 'A-B-C / Always Be Closing'
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-b-c-always-be-closing/id1510764960?i=1000473027512">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-b-c-always-be-closing/id1510764960?i=1000473027512</a>

At the same time I find a similar role advertised in Boylston Worcester MA region on PepsiCo jobs site.

And I connect the dots and realize this is probably the same or similar role. 

Nice! I feel like I got an insider information and I feel empowered!

Also somehow it empowers me to continue talking with other companies too, like Sherwin-Williams.

--- Day 6.

On Day 6 now I get creative and close my eyes and use my imagination.

I close my eyes and imagine my Boss is Atticus from the podcast.

And it's my job to make sure the Fritos and Pepsi Zero get from our warehouse, to the store, and then into the hands of the customer.

And I imagine that, like described on the podcast, I'm calling on local Large Format stores like Walmart or Target, and doing store visits and phone calls, to make sure the displays are stocked, shiny, and yummy, and easy for the customers to buy.

And I'm imagining having calls with my boss and with the warehouse and with the truck drivers. And I'm running my sales numbers in the morning and at night.

I'm imagining our customers are having cookouts and parties, or going hiking outdoors, or taking a lunch break at work, and they want tasty and refreshing food and beverages like Fritos Corn chips, to keep them going. And that they love the brand and they trust these snacks brands to give them that same tasty experiece every time. A good value at a reasonable price, I call it in my dream.

Pausing, snapping back to reality.

Is this what it would be like to work sales for PepsiCo?

I don't know, but, now that I researched, and used my imagination, I'll be a stronger candidate when I do apply. 

And I also know that the company that I'll be applying to is "Peps-uh-co". Not "Pepsee-Coh"!!!!


In conclusion, these were some stories about researching PepsiCo, while aiming for a possible career in a similar role.
