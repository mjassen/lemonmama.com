<h2>Scotland and Massachusetts and India in the late 1700s</h2>
What a thrill to read in "The Anarchy" book that someone, Ochterlony, was born in Scotland, then settled in Massachusetts, then finally lived in India and liased with the Indian Emperor.

This quote is from “the anarchy”* (book). In the later chapters. (Page 384 (in the last chapter called "the corpse of india")).

Here:

“…According to the Shah Alam Nama, Lake ...conversed with the blind Emperor through his deputy, Colonel Sir David Ochterlony. Ochterlony's father was a Highland Scot who had settled in Massachusetts. When the American…” “…Revolution broke out. His loyalist family fled to Canada, and David entered the Company's army in 1777. He never returned to the New World. and, having made India his home, vowed never to leave it.”

More on the persona of David Octherlony:

In conclusion, amazing to read of this surreal, yet very concrete, connection between Massachusetts and India, more than 200 years ago.
