<h2>Magformers</h2>
Magformers are a great tool for building and experimenting, and it is very fun.
There are many pieces to it, such as: square, triangle, long triangle, trapezoid, and much more. There are many sets, but I just have the basic one. There are lots of things that you can make, but here are some ideas:

Here is a picture I took of the ‚Äúflower ball‚Äù(no. 3 on the page):

But there are many more things in this book, or you can just use your imagination!
I like this toy because it is fun to play with, easy to take out and put away, and there are endless possibilities of what you could make!
Have fun playing! ü§©
