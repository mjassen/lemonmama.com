<h2>One Way How To Stop Spending So Much</h2>
Just shine a light on it.

I'm not gonna beat myself up for spending too much money. 
Honestly, I don't think that willpower is going to help me at this stage. 
Instead, at this stage, I'm going to write down in a little notebook.

In other words. Start tracking every cent in and out of my life.
There's no need at this stage, to make a "Budget", nor to hire a bookkeeper nor accountant. 
Not yet. 

Subconscious spending, or compulsive spending or shopping, first just needs to be observed.
Just shine a light on it.
I need to have a simple powerful tool to just consciously start recording my spending.

So I will write down in my notepad every time I spend any money.

Because it will add extreme clarity to where the money comes from and where the money goes to.
It will break the unconscious spending habit just a little bit.
It will weaken the bad habit a little bit, by adding a dose of consciousness to the spending.

I'm not going to try to manipulate myself, nor guilt myself, into spending less at this stage at this point.
Instead, I will use one tool, and one action, that could be used by anyone, to empower one's personal finances.

I'm not going to feel ashamed at my subconscious spending at this point. 
However I am going to start logging it.
Logging it to gain insight and knowledge as to where the money is coming from and where the money is going to.

So simple and yet so powerful.

I don't even need to look back at my spending notebook log either. 
Ever. 
Just the act of logging each spend that I make is the main point of this habit. 
The conscious logging, of each time I spend something, starts to break down the unconscious spending habit.

However. 
If at any point I am in my happy place and not feeling any blame for myself, then, if I feel like it, then I can take out my notebook log and look to see what I purchased.
And if so then that could add futher clarity. 
But only if I'm in the mood to view what my spending was without judging myself nor guilting myself about it!

In conclusion, this is one way how to stop spending so much.
