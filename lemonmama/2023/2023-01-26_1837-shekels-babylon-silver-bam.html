<h2>Awesome About Shekels Similar to Silver Bams</h2>
OK this is awesome, so interesting because the idea is similar to Silver Bams*

* <a href="https://lemonmama.com/wieldsilver/2022/2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-01_2305_silver_bams">https://lemonmama.com/wieldsilver/2022/2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-01_2305_silver_bams</a>

So listening to the first part of this book called "The Richest Man in Babylon"**.

** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon</a>

The book says Babylon was the first place where money was ever used.
Looked it up on Wikipedia. And they talk about how they used "shekels".
And then Wikipedia and started to talk about how many shekels per year laborers were paid.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel</a>

"…a weight of 11.5 grams[*] per shekel in Israel during the monarchy. When used to pay labourers, recorded wages in the ancient world range widely. The Code of Hammurabi (circa 1800 BC) sets the value of unskilled labour at approximately ten shekels per year of work, confirmed in Israelite law by…"

And so of course I relayed that back in my mind to "Silver Bams". Nice.

Further note on related entry on how many grams may be a shekel. According to this, 11.5 silver grams based on this other article saying that a shekel is traditionally silver:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_coinage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_coinage</a>

'...a similar silver coin, the siglos[sigloi] (...shékel) ...'

In conclusion, amazing to learn of "Shekel" and how, 4000 years ago, yearly wages were standardized and commoditized in the context of silver coinage!
