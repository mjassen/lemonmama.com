<h2>A Review of SNL Episode 1850</h2>
Somebody: 
Emma Stone

Wanted: 
To host SNL with musical guest Noah Kahan whose band played banjo guitar and sang about drinking in vermont. Very catchy tunes. And Tina Fey inducted Stone into the '5 Timers club'

But:
Michael Che and Colin Jost reported fake news as usual, reported that George Santos was expelled from Congress. Also, Bowen Yang as Santos played piano and pulled a fake baby out of the piano.

So:
We learned that Disney will future come out with two more "Frozen" movie sequels, so a 3rd and a 4th "Frozen" movie that is.

Then:
Michael Longfellow came on dressed as a huge cigarette and talked how disposable vapes are being restricted these days. Yang, Stone, and others acted a sketch where they rode around naked on garbage trucks in NYC. 

The above were featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEY97fGoeAY&list=PLS_gQd8UB-hKZWClnyRgjg_yg9Xl8SQaB">Saturday Night Live season 49 Episode 6</a>
