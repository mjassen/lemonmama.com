<h2>2013 to 2023 -- Since 10 Years Ago Tomorrow -- Blogging About Talking With Colleagues and Solving Jobs and Writing Things Down</h2>
Just reflecting back tomorrow will be 10 years to the day since my first post having to do with professional topics, talking with colleagues, solving jobs, writing things down etc.

So here is link to the first post 10 years ago:

<a href="https://lemonmama.com/investorworker/2013.html#2013-09-30_214404">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ Inaugural Post</a>

And then after that post, it has been off an on continuous for 10 years now, but has gone through some iterations but here has been a basic roadmap:

2013 ---> wieldlinux.com
---> investorworker.com
---> wieldsilver.com
---> lemonmama.com ---> 2023

Finally, hmm, interesting that 10 years later, my latest blog post today, was about professional networking.

Althought in between other topics came in strong too, notably personal finance and investing topics, etc. etc. and then specific professional career topics tapered off (software tech support and development, etc.)

So here is link to my latest post today that is 10 years later:

<a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-09-29_2221-one-networking-per-day.html">Notes How To Have One Professional Networking Meeting Per Day</a>

I guess it means just that my work here isn't done.

In conclusion, wow 10 years blogging legit. What a journey. Maybe time to do a more thorough look through of what I was writing over the decade, and see what was 'shit' vs. what was 'the shit'. Like what blog posts were crap vs. what blog posts stood the test of time. Here's to 10 more years of blogging about Career, Business, and Life! Cheers!
