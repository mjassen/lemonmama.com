<h2>Review: Motley Fool Answers podcast episode “Dividends: Next Level Stuff”</h2>
This was an excellent podcast episode:

<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/motley-fool-answers/id954072332?i=1000461818929">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/motley-fool-answers/id954072332?i=1000461818929</a>

1.)
Around the 14 minute mark, they explain how dividends can go lower. 
They say when interest rates are low in the ecosystem, then people, investors, tend to pile onto solid dividend stocks instead, and so the stock price goes high relatively.
And so now a dividend stock that would have had a percentage yield of maybe 5% at when the stock price was at a lower price, that same stock is now having a dividend percentage yield of maybe 1% or 2% because the price of the stock is so high and the price is a factor of the yield.

2.)
Lemon Mama's note on this is, wow. 
Well that answers that question.
I saw in 2022, many stocks with dividends of 1% to 3%.
Whereas in prior years and prior decades, more stocks had a higher dividend like 4% to 8%. 
And throughout history like:
"Folks 313 Years Ago Described as Making an 8 Percent Dividend"
<a href="https://lemonmama.com/wieldsilver/2022/2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-23_2011">https://lemonmama.com/wieldsilver/2022/2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-23_2011</a>
Wow. 
Thanks to Motley Fool Answers Podcast for speaking to this. 

3.)
Then, just before the 23 minute mark, the guest says something interesting he says yes just do a little research and then you you’ll be ready to jump in and buy your first stock your first dividend stock. 
And then he says but you know I recommend buying at least three stocks don’t just buy one stock at first because if you buy one stock then you’ll probably end up looking like either a genius or an idiot.

4.)
Lemon Mama's note on this is, yes that’s funny and that’s well said. 
It's been a while since I heard anyone say to buy as few as three stocks. 
So that’s refreshing I like to hear it, I do like this idea like:
"The Charming but Dangerous Idea That I Only Need One Good Company To Get Rich"
<a href="https://lemonmama.com/wieldsilver/2022/2022-q2-blog.html#2022-04-03_1508_charming-dangerous-one-company">https://lemonmama.com/wieldsilver/2022/2022-q2-blog.html#2022-04-03_1508_charming-dangerous-one-company</a>
But anyways it’s also funny that he said like “you look you’ll end up looking probably like either a genius or an idiot“. Because it’s in many cases true that one stock may you never know how it’s gonna end up really bad or really good.

In conclusion, this was a great and informative podcast episode, I recommend if folks are interested in this stuff, then to go back and listen to this episode!
