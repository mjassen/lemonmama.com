"A part of all you earn is yours to keep"
- The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason (book) (chapter 2 main lesson)

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-Magic-Story/dp/1939438632">https://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-Magic-Story/dp/1939438632</a>
  
It means you get to keep some of what you earn, maybe 10%, and but the other ~90% would go back into society. But the 10% would be yours to keep. So share but also keep some for yourself. 'nuff said.

In conclusion, you don't get to keep all you earn, but you can keep some, and, you would share much of what you eaarn, this is maybe not intuitive but is reasonable.
