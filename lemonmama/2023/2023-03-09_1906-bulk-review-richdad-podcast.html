<h2>Bulk Review 12x Awesome Rich Dad Radio Podcast Episodes OH YEAH</h2>

Or: “Review: A Dozen Rich Dad Radio Podcast Episodes Worth Listening.”

Ok so what this is here is quick reviewing about a dozen Rich Dad Radio podcast episodes that are worth listening if you like this sort of stuff!

They are talking about money topics and macroeconomics topics.

With a couple sentences what each one was about and Lemon Mama opinions about each one.

Here are the reviews of the episodes:

1.
"How to Thrive in this WILD Economy: New Strategies for Inflation, Real Estate, and Volatile Markets"
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/nomi-prins-6">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/nomi-prins-6</a>
* The podcast guest is the persona of Nomi Prins, iterates saying central banks are fabricating money, and that increases anger amongst the poor and middle class.
* Lemon Mama note: Wow this is heavy stuff, feel some truth in there for 2022/2023, and just listening to this makes want to run out and stock up on canned goods.

2.
“4 Signs the U.S. Dollar May Be Toast”
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/andy-schectman">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/andy-schectman</a>
* they talk about BRICS don't want to be dependent on the US dollar, and the 'the belt and road initiative'.
* Lemon mama note. Hope everyone can prosper. No matter what country. Amazing if you live in America and this is new to you, then you will cry listening to this episode. Good stuff.

3.
“The Retirement Crisis Balloons”
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/ted-siedle-1">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/ted-siedle-1</a>
* The guest is the persona of Ted Siedle, and they they talk about Rhode Island government pensions got mis-managed, and also commercial ariline pilots pensions, and the host or guest boldly posits the money was effectively 'stolen'.
* Lemon Mama note: They are brilliant the way he states it so bluntly; the money like stimulus money is coming from somewhere, apparently like they say it’s being taken from somewhere in order to be given to somewhere else, as they said in past and I mostly agree like, it’s like a classic 'Robin Hood' scenario playing out again and again.

4.
“The Crash of a Lifetime”
Rich Dad Radio Show
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/harry-dent-5">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/harry-dent-5</a>
* The podcast guest the persona of Harry Dent, saying like, 2008 economy crash housing bubble, government tried to control this, but you can't cover it up, pumping it up since 2008, so it may crash again?
* Lemon mama note: Does bubble/crash mean that when it does crash suddenly, that is the moment when we are repaying our past selves? Or the value is being taken from overseas labor, or both?... Food for thought.

5.
"Real Economy vs Fake Economy"
Rich Dad Radio Show
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/nomi-prins-5">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/nomi-prins-5</a>
* And they’re saying that what happens when the market is real economy is disconnected, is that ultimately taxes inflation it’s the middle-class working class blue-collar poor class of people who ultimately bear the burden. why? Because they're saying that’s always who bears the burden because that’s what the “real economy“ is, the real economy is the working people.
* Lemon Mama note: Wow, hard knocks. Scary but good to listen to this point of view. Popular media doesn't talk about this much.. They are pointing out that it’s a cause-and-effect relationship. And so the podcast host + guests are just laying it all out there so I appreciate that.

6.
“Where to invest your money in 2023”
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/jay-martin">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/jay-martin</a>
* 24m.0s. mark thereabouts the guest the persona of Jay Martin says like ' ...you want to see where the next big avalanche of money is going to be, and place yourself in front of it...'
* Nice. An abundance of money in our world. Applies to money investing and also to 'job searching', sez I.

“4 Economic Disasters in 2023 - Part 2”
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/jim-rickards-6">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/jim-rickards-6</a>
* At ~ the 23:45 mark, kiyosaki again says like: "...I invest in real estate because of debt, and the more debt I have the less tax I pay..."
* Lemon mama note: And he said this countless times in previous episodes on this podcast, and so now it's starting to sink in, kudos to Kiyosaki for helping folks learn this by repetition!

8.
“Real Estate Outlook in 2023”
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/radio/2022/december/december-21,-2022">https://www.richdad.com/radio/2022/december/december-21,-2022</a>
* The guest the persona of Ken McElroy and they are saying in tough times what saves his butt is his tenants are paying their rent.
* They are hammering on how important good tenants are and how closely related work income is from tenants to landlords.
* Ok this episode is a treasure trove of awesome quotes so putting some of them here. If you like these then do go listen to this episode I say!! Quotes here:
** "if your neighbor loses their job, its a recession; if you lose your job, it's a depression"
** Before 38:55 Kiyosaki says like: 'the Fed, the Federal Reserve Bank, is a private institution, it's not a government-run institution. And they're running the country....'
** "money goes where it's treated best..."
** "hope? ... don't hope! do! hope is for hopeless people!"

9.
“The Great Wealth Shortcut: How to Fast Track Your Journey to Financial Freedom”
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/jason-hartman-tom-wheelwright">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/jason-hartman-tom-wheelwright</a>
* Kiyosaki gets angry on the podcast, no joke, he sounds sincerely angry, advocating for listeners. They are saying don't just work hard at a job and save money in some savings or IRA without using your brain. But then also they half-joke (again as in past episode) about how __doctors__ in particular have it hard because they earn a lot and are __taxed a ton__.
* Lemon Mama note: Thanks to the podcast for advocating for working folks; also LOL my doctor did try to overbill me lately, so, I think it's real that doctors feel the pain (!).

10.
"Why You Should Prepare for a Crash Landing" (2022-Oct-12)
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-15">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-15</a>
* Guest the persona of Richard Duncan, they are talking about China labor and exploited labor and how the US Federal Reserve manipulates money; "quantitative tightening" of ~ a hundred billion dollars per month even sometimes.
* Lemon mama note: Thanks to podcast folks for shining light on this, interesting to hear some specifics of how politicians may be pulling levers and how it affects earthlings and affects Americans. I recommend anyone interested in this stuff, to listen to this episode!
Also the stuff they are saying lines up with history books in general and with common sense, and so I do believe much of what they are saying to be true. For example in "The Anarchy".

11.
“4 Signs the U.S. Dollar May Be Toast”
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/andy-schectman">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/andy-schectman</a>
* At the ~45m. mark they are saying how it can literally be possible for the ENTIRE stock market to be inflated. At just about the 59 minute mark, the guest actually suggests that he thinks it may be possible for (stocks and bonds and cash and real estate) to ALL CRASH AT THE SAME TIME.
* Lemon mama note: This is my SECOND listen of this episode. Worth it. Also, the ENTIRE stock market inflated OMGWTFBBQ??!!! Good to know, nice to consider further. I will take this all with a grain of salt, but they are putting compelling arguments here so kudos to the podcast host/guests.

12.
Rich Dad Radio podcast episode:
"How Biden’s Executive Order will Change the Monetary System"
<a href="https://richdad.com/podcasts/jim-rickards-1">https://richdad.com/podcasts/jim-rickards-1</a>
* Talking about government control of bank accounts and control of people
** They are saying citizens want to peaceful protest but government pulling strings to prevent peaceful protest.
Including:
** The pattern of governments moving to digital currency, and also governments starting to push/pull taxes from citizens bank accounts at will
** The quesion is implied or asked: Will cash go away more than already has?
** They talk about how truckers peaceful protests in Canada in 2022 and government seems to froze the citizen truckers bank accounts.
** They talk aobut how in China in 2022 citizens want to peaceful protest unfair mortgage schemes and government freezes their payment accounts thus the Chinese citzens can't ride trains to peaceful protest.

** Personally, makes me want to buy gold and silver and canned food, and also small business ownership and also real estate income too.
