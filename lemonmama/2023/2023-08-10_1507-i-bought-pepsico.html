<h2>I bought PepsiCo -- 2023 Week 32</h2>
After a long hard working career.
  
So that by the time I'm ready to retire.
Then I will have some money.
For paying for stuff, in old age.

The goal is to save and invest 1/10 of each my paycheck.



So with 10% of my last paycheck I bought PepsiCo company. (ticker symbol PEP).
So I bought ₷¤2.3 silver bams of PepsiCo.



Here's some metrics on PepsiCo right now. A snapshot in time of PEP performance:

Name                               | PepsiCo, Inc.
Ticker                             | PEP
2023-08-08 Total Return 3yr        | 13.1
2022 Total Return 3yr              | 14.5
2022 div yield%                    | 2.5
2022 Earnings Per Share $          | 6.42
2022 market cap                    | 248,897,000,000
2022 shares outstanding            | 1,387,000,000
2022 dividends $                   | 4.53
2022 net income $ (a.k.a. earnings | 8,910,000,000
2022 P/E (price/earnings)          | 25.8



In conclusion, I put 1/10 of my last paycheck into PepsiCo company stock, to save and invest in 2023 Week 32.



Note: This isn't a recommendation to buy PepsiCo or any particular investment. I can't predict the future, I can't say PEP is or isn't a terrible choice at this moment. You should do your own due diligence and choose what, if any, investment, and do your own research and make your own decision.
