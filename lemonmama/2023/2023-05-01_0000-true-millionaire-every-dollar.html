<h2>Path Towards Moderate Wealth - True Millionaire Tracks Every Dollar</h2>
"The Millionaire Next Door"
<a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11634754">https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11634754</a>

This is an audiobook. 
They are talking about true millionaires, for example folks who have a million dollars, not who spend a million dollars.
Folks who have a million dollars and who also have systems in place to sustain that million dollars without it evaporating or draining away, in other words they have a million dollars and at the same time their expenses are also covered ongoing besides that without needing to dip into that million dollars as well besides.
Two points to take away for this blog post:
• In the audiobook, before the 19 minute mark, the author says millionaires tend to have a budget.
• And also they are saying that millionaires tend to know how much they spend each year in sub categories such as groceries (presumed housing and clothing too etc.)etc. etc.

And that’s it. Once again it's a reminder that I. Have. To. Know. How. Much. I. Spend. And. What. I. Am. spending. My. Money. On.

These ideas are gonna be a huge huge huge key in my, and anyone’s, path towards financial independence and path towards moderate wealth. 
We really have to know exactly how much we’re spending, and what we’re spending it on. 
Down to the last dollar.
Do you know what? two main books both, each, taught this importance. 
That’s this book (The Millionaire Next Door), and then also the other book called "Your Money or Your Life"
<a href="https://find.minlib.net/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3736635">https://find.minlib.net/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3736635</a>
In "Your Money Or Your Life", they said something like, that once you really pay attention to every dollar you spend, and know exactly what you are spending your money on, then, you will actually automatically start becoming more frugal just naturally automatically, like via conscience and intuition telling you and compelling you to be more frugal since you know where your money is going at every given moment.

I recommend anyone who is interested in these ideas, to read both of these books!
