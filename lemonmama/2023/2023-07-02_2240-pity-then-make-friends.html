<h2>Have A Pity Party and then Suck It Up and Go Make Friends</h2>
people say it's hard to be the new kid at school or the new person in town, but I say there's something harder and that's being the new person in town for nine years and then realizing you still didn't make quality relationships with friends and so now you need to go make quality relationships with friends.
Well that's just a pity party so it's still possible so just do it



In conclusion, I can have a pity party and cry myself to sleep on my pillow that I don't have enough friends, but then in the end I still need to suck it up and go pick up the phone and knock on doors and ask questions and listen to people near me and be generous with my attention and make friends, i need to myself go do it.
