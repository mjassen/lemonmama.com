<h2>A City Slicker Can More Change Their Mood</h2>
Hypothesis:
"A city slicker can more change their mood very fast, bumpkin more always keeps the same consistent mood."

What I mean is that a city slicker continually easily snap the mood from sort of a business mood to a friendly mood without even hardly thinking of it.

Whereas a bumpkin more so tends to stay in a consistent mood, and usually defaults to a friendlier mood.

I believe this stems from, because a bumpkin needs to be much more sensitive especially in the short term ,to stay on good terms with everyone around them come because there are less people around them(in the rural/country).

Whereas a city slicker has more for choices of more people around them (literally more people there because it's the urban/city )so they can really test the limits of people liking them in the short term versus long-term so they will be more aggressive with their mood snaps and mood swings, and not as much worry about short-term alienating their peers.

In conclusion, statistically speaking, a city slicker can more change their mood, compared to a bumpkin.
