<h2>Business Idea Video Podcast and Each Each Episode Draw a Timestamped Bitsycard</h2>
Business idea. 
Video podcast commemorated by drawing timestamped bityscards.
Then sell the bitsycards as original/collector/art/nostalgia.
Or else keep the bityscards as mementos.

and each time someoney buys one we put it in an envelope and mail it to them.

Hear me out.

Revives the following.
All of which keep rolling around in my head.
The following:

• Timestamps
• Bitysycards
• Own your own business
• Kids and family can join
• Not only these but 20 MIN NETWORKING MEETING.
• •  that's right Fool, I am stumbling inviting folks to networking meetings.
• • and so this way it is a synergistic byproduct that I FINALLY get to ALSO CONTINUE MY '1000X face-to-face networkign meetings'
• A bityscard is a mini blog basically like a micro tweet/post including a drawing
• Selling stuff serially at a flea market or online
* Cute stickers/drawings online store (bitsycard.com)
• popsicle sticks cute slogans
• Salem MA vendor booth man e.g. sold art of dogs breeds for $22/$32 a pop (!)
• it can be a marketplace or else a store or both
• like Carl Barks ended up making fan art

and each time I sell a bitsycard, I put the bitsycard in an envelope and send it to the community fan person in this case and they send paypal /square payment for e.g. ₷¤2 Silver Bams to the 'bitsycard.com' company paypal account.

the first podcast episode can be on youtube.com
simultaneous on rumble.com
learn from russel brand that don't lock into one platform
and the first sale of bitsycard can be sold on ebay.com
and the second one on etsy.com
and the blog post corresponding and the accompany ing high res images of each bitsycard can be on the show site e.g. bitsycard.com

moving on.

HEAR ME OUT IT CAN/WILL BE SCRAPPY TO START 
this means that at first it can be all over the place in pieces.
one pice on youtube.
one piece on bitsycard.com (the main hub here actually so that will be a rock to start)
one piece on etsy.com
one piece on ebay.com
one piece is me calling my friend/colleague on my dumb phone to invite them onthe podcaset.
one piece is me ringing my neighbor's doorbell to invite them on hte podcast.

side note, try to network with other local artists/vendors/marketplaces for cute art / art. like artist Alfa in local town. moving on.

ok mootivational note:
"...
'onet.revive BITSYCARD.COM 
do it.
solo episodes to start.
then invite guest.
after guest. after guest. after guest.
to come on the podcast and to draw
(a) bitsycard(s). 1% 1% 1%. 
then keep going. then try to do 
1 per day
1 short video blog post per day.
then each time 1x bitsycard creation.
then each time possibility to sell that 1x bitsycard.
$80 each time ---> bitsycard.com bank account via paypal/square
1x bitsycard physical paper card each time ---> put in envelope and mail to the fan/customer who bought it.
..."

ok moving on.

Ok so a user case 'story' of how this could work:

So we have a guest on the video podcast each day (week).
And publish that.
Then while guest host are talking we/they draw a bitsycards and timestamp(/sign) those and show those to the camera and upload those online.
And probably/optionally we sell those online store /etsy / ebay during/after the show.
I.e. it is (one/ the) thing that funds the show.
The making/selling of bitsycards not only funds the show.
It also produces unique art.
It also connects the show hosts with the fans.
Like a movie star or author signing their book/album for a fan.
like a meme.
like a teeturtle.com t-shirt
like a cute teeturtle.com sticker.


'Story' 2:
Say I have a famous podcaster, say someone called Roe Jogan, on as a guest. 
nice, that is something to aspire to!
and he and I each draw 3x bitsy cards while talking on the episode.
and we each sign each of our bitsycards and datestamp each one
and we show each bitsycard to the camera during/after it's done to prove its the one
and we upload these 6x bitsycards during/after the show for sale.
we do also preserve a high-res image of each bitsycard on the show site too for our own purposes
that we can dual license to use the images later for us too
and but the fan who ends up buying the actual original can also have one dual license too plus they have the original whereas we have a high res quality of the card
Continue the story.
some fan of Roe Jogan likes the episode and likes Roe Jogan and likes the bityscard #1 that Roe J. drew.
the fan goes on the show site / etsy.com / ebay and buys the bitsycard for fixed price $20 or else for an auction for $x,xxx.xx
i mean c'mon if The Real Roe Jogan really came on my podcast and drew it and it really sold then probably sold in 2023 for a thousand dollars.
and i put the bitsycard in an envelope and send it to Roe Jogan's fan person in this case and they send paypal /square payment for ₷¤2 Silver Bams to the 'bitsycard.com' company paypal account.


'story' 3:
i have my friend from Massachusetts local town on the video podcast show.
it is my family member Quebec or local artist Alfa or my neighbor India,
...or Romeo or Zulu or my family member Golf,
...or SOLO EPISODE MORGAN J. or Bravo from my Toastmasters group or Tango,
...or Whiskey from my work or Lima or Hotel,
...or my high school friend Victor or Mike or Delta,
...or the teacher from my community school Foxtrot or my neighbor Sierra or Echo,
...or Juliett or Uniform or Yankee from my toastmasters club, ...
And they draw a bityscard on the show
and I do.
Say its my family member Quebec.
then we upload the episode
and upload the bitsycard for sale.
who would watch the episode?
who would buy the bitsycard?
probably Quebec's parent or child or grandparent or relative if someone?
then lets say next week the teacher from my community school Foxtrot comes on the show and draws and uplaods .
who would watch the show?
and who buy the bitsycard?
maybe a student from the community school?
sez my small but realistic imagination...
next my co-worker, Tango, comes on let's say
who would listen? who would buy the bitsycards?
maybe someone colleague from our workplace, or a customer from our workplace, or else Tango's family/relative?
and i put the bitsycard in an envelope and send it to Tango's relative and they send paypal /square payment for $20 to the 'bitsycard.com' company paypal account.

ok so we see a pattern here.
i am imagining that the folks who at all realistically would possibly listen to the podcast and who whould possibly realistically at all buy the bitsycard(s) associated with each podcast episode are the following:

* colleague of the podcast host/guest
* toastmaster peer of the podcast host/guest
* school student/teacher/peer  of the podcast host/guest
* family member  of the podcast host/guest
* friend  of the podcast host/guest
* prior customer (for any previous sale private or public)  of the podcast host/guest
* employer of the podcast host/guest
* employee  of the podcast host/guest
* some community group member who belongs to the same community group tribe of the podcast host/guest
* someone who likes and inspires / inspired by the podcast guest/host and enjoys supporting the podcast guest/host by listening the episode and by buying the commemorative bitsycard.

and i put the bitsycard in an envelope and send it to Foxtrot's student fan person in this case and they send paypal /square payment for $20 to the 'bitsycard.com' company paypal account.

moving on.


'story' 4:

Gavid Dardner comes on and draws a bitsycard.
Thank you to Gavid Dardner in this dream sequence, it is something to aspire to, to invite him on the podcast some future time, a dream.
we put it for sale.
a fan of Gavid Dardner's podcast buys the bitsycard.
and i put the bitsycard in an envelope and send it to Gavid Dardner's fan person in this case and they send paypal /square payment for ₷¤2 Silver Bams to the 'bitsycard.com' company paypal account.

Samila Jouffrant then comes on.
a fan of her podcast buys the bitsycard.
then I imagine I go on 'DPB podcast'. and while there I draw a bitsycard and show it to Datrick Pet-Bavid's audience.
then I come back and post that and put it for sale.
a fan of DPB podcast then buys my bitsycard because they saw/liked me that time on the DPB podcast.

that's it!

cool business idea.
it's like marketing and selling arbitrary unique art.



In conclusion, the above has been a painfully rough draft that outlines a possible business idea, involving making a video podcast where each episode we draw a timestamped bitsycard.
