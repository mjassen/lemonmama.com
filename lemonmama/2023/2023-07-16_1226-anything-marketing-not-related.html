<h2>Anything Marketing Not Related to Anything</h2>
It really is A Thing that you can really use anything to market and endorse anything else, even if the two aren't related.

I had a hunch that marketing could be nearly anything.

So I decided I was going to just blog about whatever I wanted to blog about and then post ads for whatever I wanted to sponsor even if it wasn't related to what I was blogging about.

See for exmaple links to 5x products at the top of my post, none of which are related to the content of the post itself:
"Win Win" <a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-07-07_0016-win-win-keep-share.html">https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-07-07_0016-win-win-keep-share.html</a>

But something nagging says what if that doesn't work?

Because lots of folks do blogging about products and then place links to those products in that blog post.

I say that's good if you mean it, however, you'd have to be very focused on something and be able to get the attention of the specific product vendor you're working with, in order for everything to align in order to make that work.

And I feel like there's a 1% chance of being able to do that.

And I feel like it's more like a 99% chance that folks are trying to leverage blogs to promote products when they don't really use that exact same product themself or they don't use a similar product either.

I like marketing to be organic and transparent. In other words genuinely blog about what you think/say/do/use and then also post ads to what you also genuinely think/say/do/use too.

And guess what I feel like there's only about a 1% chance you're going to be blogging about a product that you are also using too, and again a 1% chance that the vendor for that particular product is ready to pay you to post an ad for that exact product too.

So it would be way more organic and genuine to just blog what you're gonna blog, and then use what product you're gonna use, even though the two aren't really related.

So what's gratifying is in the real world I started to see a few folks doing the same thing. 
Not many, but a few.

Example 1:
I saw a bank has an ice cream truck to promote it's banking services.
Right, bank and finance and money and banking has nothing to do with ice cream.
But the bank marketers still decided to have an ice cream truck to go around with their logo on it and presumably go around and give out free ice cream to promote their bank.
Nice.
They're not pretending that banking has anything to do with ice cream.
They just want to get their name out there in public. And they think ice cream truck is a valid way to do it. So they did it. 

Example 2:
Then I saw a podcast who I think is doing the same thing.
"TIP351: The Psychology of Money w/ Morgan Housel We Study Billionaires - The Investor’s Podcast Network"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-study-billionaires-the-investors-podcast-network/id928933489?i=1000523526473">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-study-billionaires-the-investors-podcast-network/id928933489?i=1000523526473</a>
In the show notes to their podcast, they have ads for stuff that they didn't mention in this podcast episode, nor are really directly related to what they said on the podcast. 
In other words they're just unapolagetically promoting links to non-related products, like:
'... (ZipRecruiter and Kraken and Monday.com and Orbi WiFi 6 from netgear and ExpressVPN)...'
So in other words, this podcast promotes arbitrary stuff in their show notes. Yahsss!! So this validates like what i was thinking for a while when I'm posting 5x unrelated products links in the top of my blog post on my blog. 

In conclusion, even though it's arbitrary, it's DIRECT so they (and renewed again I) think it will work. And so my point is, it really is A Thing that you can really use anything to endorse anything else, even if the two aren't related. That's all it's really A Thing.
