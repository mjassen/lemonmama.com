<h2>Napping Out Loud and Staying Healthy</h2>
Napping Out Loud means being a badass with my resting, and getting plenty of rest so I can stay healthy.

If I need to rest, then I just do it.

Downtime.
Resting.
Snoozing.
Napping.

For americans, resting during the day is taboo, it seems lazy and people will judge me If I rest during the day.

But on the other hand, did you ever go out on the town or anywhere, and you saw someone dressed for work at lunchtime, just taking a nap in the park like on a bench or chair in the middle of the day, and you think to yourself, wow, what a badass, they are tired so they're napping, what common sense, what audacity!

"Napping Out Loud", I call it.


Now, 3 Stories about napping.


1.)
First, I can't not mention some expert nappers. You probably know who I'm talking about. Quick poll: who comes to mind when you think of someone expert at napping? ...
That's right, its old people. 
You might also have guessed babies. 
Well in both cases you would have been right. 
I worked at home during the day, and grandpa came to visit and was babysitting our toddler. One day I came down for lunch and I saw the kid was asleep on the couch and grandpa was sitting nearby resting too, leaning back with his eyes closed. 
It was priceless.
Old people and babies. We can learn from them. 
Experts at Napping Out Loud!!!!!!!!


2.)
Second story is as follows.
My friend goes on a business trip to Shanghai. 
On the first day, in the afternoon time, things get quiet.
Ok that seemes normal for lunch time, maybe people are going out for lunch right?
Then after lunchtime ended, the lights all went out.
In all the offices. 
In the middle of the day.
It turns out this is a reglar thing for a corporate office in Shanghai.
The company shuts off all the lights in all the offices and rooms of the facility, every afternoon, for an hour or two.
The company policy is everyone is supposed to rest, and they mean it. Working isn't allowed nor expected.
Napping Out Loud strikes again!!!!!!!!


3.)
The third story is about a type of resting that I created.
I essentially sit resting for 20 minutes or so, but I have given it a grandiose name to make others take it more seriously. 
I specifically call this activity the following:
"Nothing Time, Where I Do Nothing, And I Do Nothing A Second Time, And Where I Say No To Folks."
And then I proceed to sit for 20 minutes or more im my chair or wherever, and then whenever my roommate or whoever comes up and asks me anything I tell them like:
"no, but ask me again in about 20 minutes. Right now I'm having:
"Nothing Time, Where I Do Nothing, And I Do Nothing A Second Time, And Where I Say No To Folks."

Napping Out Loud to the rescue!!!!


Having listened to the preceding 3 stories, you may STILL ask me, but ok, why is this important?
Why does anyone need to be a badass about napping?
Can't we just power through like usual?
Or else sneak away on our lunch break to some quiet place where nobody can see us to take a nap sometimes?

I say, no.
And the main reason is we will lead healthier lives.
We should be badasses and rest and nap when we need to, and don't worry so much if petty people call us lazy.
Instead let's get the rest we need, and don't apologize for it.

But bringing it back, it's really about improving quality of life, including in the private and in the work sectors.
I personally envision that it could even help with issues such as the loneliness epidemics and mental health epidemics in 2023.
And I think we need more badasses to just put our health as a priority, and make sure to always rest enough throughout the week and throughout the day.

And so I plan to rest weekly and daily as needed from this moment on.
If there's only a shared break room available, and I only have 10 minutes or 30 minutes of break time available to me, then I'm pledging that I'm going to go ahead and heads down rest during that time if I so need to, and not apologize for doing so.
Further, to look out for my peers, if I see my colleage is burned out I will say something to encourage them to get enough rest too, no judgement zone here.



In conclusion, I think we should be napping out loud more, getting the rest we need, not apologizing for taking a nap when we need one, and most importantly we should be staying healthy.
