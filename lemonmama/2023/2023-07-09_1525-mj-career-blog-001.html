<h2>MJ Career Blog #001 for 2023 Week 28</h2>
This is a one-week career project for growth + doing + learning.

~~~ Project Plan

- In this one week project sprint, I'll ________make 1 networking meeting with a new or existing colleague_________.

- Envisioned I'll use professional networking principles from the book "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385346654">Never Eat Alone</a>" by Ferrazzi.

- Within propriety I'll be discerning the noble projects of my colleague and offering them my help with these.

- Within propriety I'll be describing my own noble projects to my colleague and asking for their help with these. Initially my noble projects are to 1.) do value-adding operations work ongoing, and to 2.) navigate myself towards ₷¤730 silver bams income.

- I may write notes daily to myself during the week.

- After the one-week project, I'll update the “Final report” here below.



~~~ Project Final Report

- During this one week project sprint I did ______not necessarily make one networking meeting however i did have a few conversations including about professional stuff and personal stuff so networking____________.

- During this one week project sprint I did ______email a colleague to follow up on a previous networking meeting. Also another colleague. Also I went in person and followed up to say thanks to a third colleague for a past networking meeting. Also i stopped in to see another colleague but they weren't there.____________.

- Did ________Attend a professional leadership speaking meeting. Toastmasters at https://twincitytoastmasters.toastmastersclubs.org/ . And speak there and listen to my colleagues speak. __________.

- Did ________Drink some wine. Did listen to 4-5 podcast episodes/videos. Did talk with a colleague who says they go to the gym nearly every morning. Thinking of calling them up and seeing if I can go to the gym with them or not too. Did go to a networking session to practice job interview skills and career development skills in-person. Did write a draft of a speech on how my professional development is intertwined with communication styles.__________.

- Did ________Feel bummed out that I am not making as much direct progress this week in my career progress as I had hoped. Did regroup and decide what I need to do is once again hard core start knocking on doors and making phone calls to professionals who are __doing the job I want to do____ and asking not only hiring managers but also worker/employee level folks in theser roles, whether they would spare 20 mintues to chat with me about what it's like do to the role they're doing and the culture and the performance needs too. Did however get cold feet and the next day fail to actually go out and for this knock on any direct door nor make any direct phone call. __________.


- Learned __________How hard it is sometimes to go and execute a good idea even if it is a good idea. Learned it is important to make a plan, try to do it. then if fail then again regroup and redouble mindset and inertia in order to work up to executing on the plan. For example even after decided to go make phone calls and knock on doors to network with managers/employees, next day still got cold feet so need to again regroup for the next day/days.__________.

- About this I think _____I'm making little wins but also little failures. And so I need to keep at it and be deliberate and keep a consistent professional strong optimistic win-win-win mindset across days and throughout the week.____________.

- About this I feel __________I'm growing but it is surely not more than 1% per day. And some days almost feels like I backslid too. So but overall I feel good especially when I pause and take 15m. to consider the week in hindsight, then the high-level picture once again comes into clarity again and I start fo feel better and more long-term optimistic again.____________.

In conclusion, I did ____talk with some peers and colleagues and did fail some and did win some and did regroup and get ready for the next step_____ and I learned ____that some of my ideas are still solid but some of my approaches will need revisiting or redoulbing, and some may need to be scrapped or tweaked and I learned I will need to keep consistent positive incremental pressure towards my noble goal if I really want to improve my life and my career______, and overall __________at this very second I'm feeling long-term optimistic about my career development and overall I am confident I will be able to form a working plan and execute a workig plan as the coming weeks progress and months progress and will be able to get better 1% 1% 1 at a time._________________.
