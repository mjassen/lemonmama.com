<h2>Use Past Human Patterns to Make Decisions</h2>
Paradigm shift.

PSA.

It's aceptable and ethical and honest to use past memories and notes of human behavior patterns from past life situations I've experienced, to make decisions during present situations that I'm facing.

Amazing.

Sometimes in past I'd think it was more unethical or manipulative or presumtive or dishonest, to apply past situations human behavior that I'd experienced or observed, onto present situations involving human behavior.

But that's not always the case.

Come to find more and more that it's fine to draw upon my knowledge of general patterns of human behavior, to presume how folks around me will act in a current situation, and act accordingly.

No need to verbally tell the present folks what I'm basing my decision on, either. However if needed or asked how i'm basing my present decision to act, i could tell a story from my past experience if there's time to do so that may build transparency trust, or i could simply say 'i know from experience' or 'that's just how people act in this type of situation.' Or not. I'm at liberty to use either method. Life isn't journalism. You're not always required to cite your sources.

Note that using past patterns of human behavior to judge how to act properly or what someone else is going to think/say/do in present, won't always work. People are human and you can damn well bet they're going to do do whatever they themselves want to do, at any given moment.

And sometimes I can judge to react the any given human-behavior-involving situation contrary to my past experiences too. Because it seems more ethical or because I am testing something or because I am using my intuition or just because I damn well want to.

But that's not the point.

The point is it's pretty much fine to go ahead and use knowledge from any/all past experiences at all times in new human interactions. In fact, turns out moreso most people most of the time are doing this. And moreseo people have been since there were people.

In past I may have moreso tried to treat most every present interaction more as if it was a brand new never seen before situation, and not try to extrapolate judgments and then actions based on my past experience. 

So if I met a new twist I'd be less so able to just make up my own decision and my own action plan.

Maybe because i was taught, and let myself learn, when young to not use prejudice and not stereotype people. Maybe because I was taught, and let myself learn when young, to smile and be nice and polite in the current situation no matter what the current situation is and no matter what my past experience with a similar situation was.

Wow what a moron.

Time to moreso say bye to old paradigm and moreso start to use this new paradigm some.

However its not to say to be human and compassionate and kind and to still use best effort and good judgement and common sense and look for the best outcome for all people involved. 

However common sense is an odd thing. It means different judgements and different actions, depending on your own experiences, and the other people involved, and how everyone's thinking/talking/acting in present. Along with a ton of moving parts factors.

Common sense encompaasses everything all rolled up into one big judgement-decision-action log basically.

And so but no need to moreso censor my knowledge and experiences from my past actions when deciing how to act going forwad.

And there'll always be more to learn. When I make mistakes going forward including using the best new paradigm, then I'll regroup and get better next time.  Use patterns next time or don't use patterns next time, depending. Always judge based on the total info as well as the new info.

LOL even folks who have been petal-to-the-metal leveraging all the human behavior patterns knowledge they posssessed, to the maximum, ever since they were a toddler, they still make mistakes and misjudgments and bad decisions and wrong actions, even based on the best pattern knowledge they have. And so sometimes they need to use patterns they know, but sometimes they need to learn new stuff. 

Don't underestimate humans' abilities and tendency to say 'f**k you I won't do what you tell me' or to be contrary just because we can, and for years on end or for their whole lifetime sometimes.

But for me this may start a new chapter of working better in a team, leveraging human behavior patterns more, and generally trying to succeed more for my teams for my tribes for earthlings.
