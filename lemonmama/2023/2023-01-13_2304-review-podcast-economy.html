<h2>Review of Rich Dad Radio Show Podcast Episode “3 Things That Will SINK the Economy”</h2>

<a href=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/3-things-that-will-sink-the-economy/id833641766?i=1000589166089">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/3-things-that-will-sink-the-economy/id833641766?i=1000589166089</a>

1.)
In the podcast episode, before the 6m. 26s. mark, the guest the persona of Jim Rickards, says something paraphrased like: '...the supply chain isn't part of the economy, the supply chain IS the economy'.

Amazing, how the guest pinpoints with clarity an important definition. Strips away what they see as BS regarding calling issues "supply chain issues" in the past year.
Instead, on the podcast they are essentially saying no one government can truly direct the supply chain nor the economy.
Rather they are saying governments can only pull some economic levers at the most.


2.)
In the episode, also the host the persona of Robert says in China in the 1980's, in stores, the shelves were bare.

Lemon Mama note: I think the point here is they are saying it could happen again. It could happen in the world and in the USA. Is what I think they are implying or saying here. Scary stuff.

3.)
Before the 25m. 25s. mark, they say companies including Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel, are pouring billions, $20 billion or more, into new fabrication facilities in Arizona and the Oregon/Washington area, and/or Ohio, now in 2022.

This is interesting, semiconductor seems to be coming more back to the USA based on this. Could be a trend. Ah, and in the news recently Warren Buffet supposedly bought up Taiwan Semiconductor if I remember as well. So.


4.)
Near 29m. 03s., Rickards says with dome sarcastic tone: (paraphrasing) '...I love the fact the government has M1, M2, M3, it shows they don't even know what money is, because they have three different flavors...'

This is also interesting, as noted in this other blog post:

5.)
--- After listening to the podcast, from memory, I believer Rickards says during the podcast, has described how Goldman Sachs deals directly with The Fed (the u.s. federal reserve)

Lemon Mama note: fascinating.

6.)
---they say currently total, there is $1 quadrillion of derivatives held by banks.
they say this $1 quadrillion is being propped up by $9 trillion in the banks. 
and that the derivitives take the form of options, swaps, futures, and hedge funds. 99% located "off balance sheet" (!!!)

Lemon Mama note: fascinating, and also scary! But this is mostly over my head at this point so I may need to fact check this, or else simply learn more about it. However I'm glad these podcasters are talking about this stuff because it's really high-level stuff and depending how accurate their sources are, the ramifications are serious!

Lemon Mama note: personally I feel that derivatives = bubble . derivatives = nothing. SCARY!!!! This type of information makes one want to go buy gold and silver and lock it in a safe deposit box, and go buy food and stock one's pantry. (Both of which they talked about on previous episodes of this podcast as well). Prepare for recession and all that stuff. Is what would be the proper action now if what they are saying is moreso accurate (!!!)



In conclusion, this was a fascinating podcast episode, and I am noting here to go back and listen to it again, I'd recommend folks who are interested in this, to yourself go and listen to this episode yourself too. Both for (presumed) factual content, and for common sense nature of the content, and for plain old lighting a fire under one's butt to take action to realize what the extent of the economy could be currently and in future. Thanks to the podcast folks for discussing this here.
