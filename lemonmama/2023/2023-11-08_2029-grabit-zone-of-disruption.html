<h2>Grabits and the Zone of Disruption</h2>
Turns out another name for a grabit is, the Zone of Disruption.

Someone, on this podcast episode, is talking about the "zone of disruption" they call it and they're saying that whenever there's a change, even if it's a change for the better, i̶f̶ there's a dip. And they mean there's a time of adjustment that's needed when you're out of your comfort comfort zone and it's difficult. and it's gonna be difficult for you and for your organization as well.


At the 12m:40s mark of this (2023 April -ish FranklinCovey on leadership podcast episode) podcast episode:
<a href="https://resources.franklincovey.com/on-leadership-with-scott-miller/255-marche-pleshette-and-andy-cindrich">https://resources.franklincovey.com/on-leadership-with-scott-miller/255-marche-pleshette-and-andy-cindrich</a>

Morgan's note is Y a a a aS! Because this is akin to in 2020 when I blogged about where any time you start to make a change there's gonna be that little bit of a rough patch or a extra tough time or a double tough time after you make that decision to change and start changing, but before the change has really taken traction. 
A similar concept to, the idea where, you had a new idea and a realization, and from that instant it's almost like you you are already a new person, but your reputation of being that new person hasn't yet happened, so people are still viewing you as an old person.

"What Do You Call Just Starting to Change a Habit"

"Rich People Problems Start When the Rich Person Mindset Starts"
<a href="https://lemonmama.com/investorworker/2019/2019-01-21-rich-mindset-rich-problems.html">https://lemonmama.com/investorworker/2019/2019-01-21-rich-mindset-rich-problems.html</a>

But anyway, I'm super stoked that these podcast guests are talking about this concept. Because I had noticed it, but I hadn't heard anyone explicitly mention it until now.

Further, in the same podcast episode, at 24m:02s they are talking now about what they're doing here they're teaching seminars about giving people language in a framework to talk about and explain and map out patterns that happen during changes.

So they are saying on the podcast episode, that how that empowers people is people and listen to the seminar and they immediately say oh yeah, I went through a big change when I went to camp moved out to go to college and it felt like just like you just said, or they say oh, I went through a huge change when I had my first child, and that pattern reminds me of what you just described or yeah, I lost my job and it was a huge change for me and you know what the words you're using to describe the different phases of that change totally describe my situation then as well, etc. etc.

Morgan's note is that yes I love it because they are empowering because they are giving words and names to the repeat patterns that happen in our lives and it's not the same change each time it's a different change however, the patterns are repeating, and the patterns are the same and we can use the same words to describe those change phases each time. Nice.

In conclusion, this concept of the "Zone of Disruption" is so epic. Because it can be used, and it can be misused, and it can be leveraged. This so-called Zone of Disruption is, as I said in my 2020 blog bost about just starting to change a habit, a scary and dynamic place.  But sooo important it is. So here's to everyone leveraging it for the better of themselves and for the better of humanity!
