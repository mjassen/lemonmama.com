<h2>Should the Following Book be in Public Domain by 2023? "The Richest Man In Babylon"</h2>
I like the book "The Richest Man in Babylon" By George Clason.

I noticed "The Richest Man in Babylon" book was apparently published in 1926.

<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/500260781">https://www.worldcat.org/title/500260781</a>

So shouldn't it be in public domain now?

As it's 2023 now.

That's more than 95 years after the first edition, so, that qualifies it if I understand.

But I noticed "The Richest Man in Babylon" book isn't on Project Gutenberg free-old-book site.

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/results/">https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/results/</a>

Ok.

I'm assuming its just only been public domain for 2-3 years at this point and its a lot of thankless work to get a book into Project Gutenberg, thus probably only why it hasn't been gotten into there yet? 

I suppose it'd need some (thankless) work to even figure this context out for sure.

So this is an exciting idea for a project.

How much would it take to get this book officially published onto Project Gutenberg site?

It could be epic project, and a public service.

I could blog about the adventure as I go, for real, epic, content, a real project where the public can benefit if we succeed.

I can try to recruit a buddy or partner to do this project with me.

We could start a podcast to tell about our progress as we go.

I could ask librarians for help and ask the folks at Project Gutenberg for guidance.

If it turns out a road trip is needed to go to some remote library to find an original 1926 copy of the book, then that could be an adventure of a roadtrip too.

I could make a friend and friends in the process.

Maybe make an enemy or two. (not on purpose, just that people driven towards a goal sometimes face opposition, period.).

With such a project it is sure to be an adventure, with stories to tell coming out of it.

Until next time...
