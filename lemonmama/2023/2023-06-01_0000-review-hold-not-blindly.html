<h2>Review: Study History Hold Companies But Not Blindly</h2>
Review podcast episode:
Motley Fool Answers
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/motley-fool-answers/id954072332?i=1000352383174">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/motley-fool-answers/id954072332?i=1000352383174</a>

On this podcast episode they mention the company names:
Polaroid, Xerox, Kmart, Schlitz, Avon, Kodak, Blockbuster.
They are talking about how these particular companies were huge and successful but ultimately ended up going down, and how we can learn lessons from these, how even some large companies can go bust.

The podcast guest is saying there’s a lesson here, that one shouldn’t just buy and hold blindly.

And so a big lesson here is, there is a fine line between
* buying and holding stock shares of a company long term blindly
vs.
* buying and holding while still paying attention periodically/regularly to your company

Lemon Mama note: 
The implication is, holding good companies is good, but during a periodic check, if I see one of my companies is no longer up to my standards or is no longer doing well, then it may be time to sell that company and buy a different, good, company instead.

I'd recommend this poscast episode to anyone who thinks this topic is interesting!

In conclusion, this episode was a reminder to keep holding good companies while ongoing still paying attention to how good each company is doing as well.
