<h2>Movie Second Review: “Sonic The Hedgehog 2”</h2>
Is this movie worth a SECOND review?

Yes, yes it is.

Somebody:
Knuckles.


Wanted:
To get glory for his family honor. He heard Robotnik's radio signal from Mushroom Planet and knew it could lead him to Sonic The Hedgehog and lead him to the Gem to fulfill his destiny.

But:
Robotnik was more into power and working with his own henchman who made great goat milk lattes and was pretty spineless, it was like a lose-win codependent relationship. And they pretty quickly labeled Knuckles as a bumpkin and they tried to use Knuckles to lead them to get the gem for themselves.

So:
The movie characters, surprisingly, in a good way, all got a pretty even distribution of screen time. Including Donut Lord and Pretzel Lady, the crazy awesome bride and her handsome fiancee, Robotnik, Knuckles, and Sonic and Tails.

Then:
Knuckles noticed two times how Robotnik showed rather bad character traits such as:
- leaving his henchman behind on the trip (Dishonor), and
- doesn't care about saving teammates whereas Sonic saves Tails as a priority in the avalanche.

Finally, this movie. was. non. stop. action. from beginning to end, with a ton of slapstick humor and action mixed together.

In conclusion, if you like animated animals mixed with people, action, humor, more humor, and more slapstick humor non stop then do watch this movie!
