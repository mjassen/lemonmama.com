<h2>Followup Questions to Ask Myself After a Networking Meeting With Someone</h2>
Questions to ask myself about a person, following up on a networking meeting with that person. 

To build consideration and to build generosity and to build gratefulness. Here:

The book "Never Eat Alone", says that professional networking if boiled down to one word would be "Generosity".

More thoughts loosely related to this.

I made a list of names of people to network with. 

Literally. Like Colleagues, friends, neighbors, family members.

I really need the 'people who I could help' list of names.
This is the one I have the most control over.
This is the one where I am adding value to other people.
This is the one where I have a chance to prove to other people that I am considerate.
It's like a miniature volunteer job opportunity, each time that I pick a name from the 'people who I could help' list.
I pick a name at random from the list and brainstorm some notes, how I may be able to help that person.
Jot down what did we last talk about.
What was on their mind and what project were they working on.
And what help did they want and what help did they need and how were they feeling?
Consider what had I observed about that person the last time we met”

In conclusion, these were some wise questions to ask myself, after having a networking meeting with someone.
