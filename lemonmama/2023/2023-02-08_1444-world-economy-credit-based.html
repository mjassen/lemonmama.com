<h2>The World Economy is Based on Credit in 2022</h2>
This is a very bold statement.

I'm glad someone has the audacity to say it.

I can feel this to be true.

But I couldn't say this myself until someone else said it.

They have been harping on this in 2022 in the Rich Dad Radio podcast throughout 2022.

It is amazing.

What a different lens to look at the world, compared to a lot of other more popular media in 2022.

And I believe there to be a lot of truth in it. Worth paying attention.

Thanks to the podcast guest and hosts for shining light on this and bringing it to forefront of awareness. 

Thanks for keeping it so high-level. So Macro.

Definitely worth a listen if you're interested in this stuff.

Before the 9m. mark of the episode, the guest the persona of Tom Wheelwright, says the WHOLE WORLD economy is based on credit now in 2022. And that that's unprecedented.



In conclusion, it may be that the entire world's economy is based on credit in 2022, and that's worth noting!
