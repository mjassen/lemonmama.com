<h2>Review： Short Squeezes， Introverts， and Extroverts</h2>
Shout out to this particular episode of Rule Breaker Investing podcast, from it I learned and got a new viewpoint.

1.) First:
At about the 25m.43s. mark, the host the persona of David Gardner here defines exactly in very simple terms what exactly is a "short squeeze" and also what a short means when you are shorting a stock.
So from this I learned what is a short squeeze.
nice.

2.) Second:
At about the 30m.59s. mark, Gardener calls out Myers-Briggs test. He says it's kind of a two dimensional model in a three dimensional world. Instead of testing or seeing whether you're an introvert or more of an extrovert, he says essentially, why don't everyone just be work on getting it better at being an introvert and also work at being better at becoming an extrovert?
In other words, he is saying, why not just max out both introvert and extrovert and be able to do both very well?
When I heard this I thought to myself HA HA HA HA HA HA HA YAAAASSSS!! 
I love it because Gardner's persona is calling out the flaw of such systems. He's calling out a false dichotomy. 
Yes, this, thank you.

In conclusion, from this podcast episode I learned what is a 'short squeeze' and got a fresh viewpoint in terms of the apparent false dichotomy of Introvert vs Extrovert. If you're interested in this then I recommend you have a listen to this podcast episode too.
