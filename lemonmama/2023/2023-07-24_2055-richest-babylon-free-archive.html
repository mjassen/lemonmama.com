<h2>Full Text of The Richest Man in Babylon Book from Archive.org</h2>
Apparently the full text of the book "The Richest Man in Babylon" by George Clason is available on archive.org.

I think this may be possible because the book was originally published in 1926 and so the 95-year public domain license has taken effect now that it's 2023.

In any case here is a link to the book scan and text and pdf etc posted now in 2023 on archive.org:

This is the html page where folks can choose their flavor (pdf or image or scanned-txt) here:
<a href="https://archive.org/details/richestmaninbaby0000geor_q8e2">https://archive.org/details/richestmaninbaby0000geor_q8e2</a>

I'm jazzed about this because this book is excellent for financial literacy inspiration, even 95 years after its original publishing. And so I think it's great that folks can now access the full text for free, online publicly.

In conclusion, that's a link to the full text of the book "The Richest Man in Babylon".
