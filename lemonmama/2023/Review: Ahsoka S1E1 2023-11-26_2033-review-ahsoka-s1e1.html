<h2>Review: Ahsoka S1E1</h2>
Episode 1 is off to a slow start, although it picks up speed in the latter half of the episode.

This series seems like it is made for serious die-hard Star Wars fans.

As someone who has never gotten into the Star Wars series, it still managed to capture my interest with its interesting plot.

There is intrigue and there is chase scenes.

The characters are not likable except for Ahsoka, but it is too early to tell.
