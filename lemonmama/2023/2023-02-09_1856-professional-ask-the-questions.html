<h2>A Professional Asks All The Questions Early And Often</h2>
NOTE THIS IS SO FUNNY READING THIS NOW 2023.

But also not funny, PAINFUL, üò≠üòüüò¨üò®üò∞üò≥üò°ü§¢ 

Because I wrote this about 60 days ago so it speaks to my immaturity including fairly recently.

So sometimes its best to just preserve something as is, to see it as an 'unedited yawp'. 

As it is telling.

And so here is an unedited rant that I wrote in my drafts folder about 60 days ago.

I am already seeing how immature this is. It hurts to read it.

However that's good; so now the value here is I see that the feeling was real and the immaturity was real. 

But it also means I sure still need to work on this stuff.

In other words, I can work on improving my character and professionalism, then come back and read this stuff, and see how far I've come each time as I become more and more professional.

Here is the paste of the unedited draft:

2022-12-06 ask questions then apply #dream job

i want to ask ALL the questions BEFORE I apply

im SICK of never having a forum to ask and answer questions

first apply, oh yeah then interview , oh yeah then make a good impresdion, THEN uou can ask questions

OH BUT WAIT remember to hold off first get an offer letter first. Oh but wait also start your first day first. And oh yeah remember dont ask hard questions your first week because you want to make a good impression. Oh also remember wait until you passed yhe 90 day review before adking any questions that would rock yhe boat. 

oh yeah then slso remember thatafter the 90 day mark you want to make sn impression like you slready know how to do the job, so be sure to mot ask any too many derp questions after yhe 90-day mark as well ...

ABULLSHIT!!!!

This last 3 paragraphs is all satire / sarcsstic.

but its not funny really.

this has been my real experience.  

constant durface pressiere to never seem dumb nor ask questions, while at the same time mounting pressure to learn the job and know the role snd  fitvthe role .

BULLSHIT IM SICK OF IT!!!!


i want to ask ALL !!! the questions BEFORE !!! I apply!!!!!!!!

this is nothing personal against anyone nor against the system. just a rant that it is some huge blind spot ive not been able to navigate well so far in my career, but hoing forward its not even optional -- i need to ASK ALL YHE QUESTIONS EARLY SND OFTEN.

FIN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ END 100% UNEDITED RANT FROM DEC. 6TH FOR SOME UNEDITED PERSPECTIVE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



In conclustion, the above unedited draft is a marker post, a benchmark, by which I can look back at it as I become more and more professional and a better and better character, and in looking back, I can see how much I'm progressing.
