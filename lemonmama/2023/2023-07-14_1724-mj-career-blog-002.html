<h2>MJ Career Blog #002 for 2023 Week 29</h2>
This is a one-week career project for growth + doing + learning.

~~~ Project Plan

- In this one week project sprint, I'll ________make 1 networking meeting with a colleague_________.

[- Update: __________ Also I'll direct job-apply to 1 "Job" (Project / Role / Company / Person) ______________.]

- Envisioned I'll use professional networking principles from the book "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385346654">Never Eat Alone</a>" by Ferrazzi.

- Within propriety I'll be discerning the noble projects of my colleague and offering them my help with these.

- Within propriety I'll be describing my own noble projects to my colleague and asking for their help with these. Initially my noble projects are to 1.) do value-adding operations work ongoing, and to 2.) navigate myself towards ₷¤730 silver bams income.

- I may write notes daily to myself during the week.

- After the one-week project, I'll update the “Final report” here below.



~~~ Project Final Report

- During this one week project sprint I did ________Meet with a few colleagues talked about career job professional stuff__________.

- Learned _________Stuff about my current company and current career opportunities___________.

- About this I think _______Wow somehow still feels like not quick enough, not direct enough, career development__________.

- About this I feel __________like I tried hard but still feel like not nearly quick enough pace. Like I am running 100 miles an hour but need to run 1000 miles per hour. Or more like ran 100 miles per hour but not in the right direction, instead it would be better to turn in the right direction then run 10 miles per hour be better.____________.

In conclusion, I did ____meet professional folks_____ and I learned ______some things ____, and overall _________however seems like I'm not yet networking quite in my groove yet maybe still need to meet folks more frequently and/or meet different folks and/or talk about different things when I meet the folks.__________________.
