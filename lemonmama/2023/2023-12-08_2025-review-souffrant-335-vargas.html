<h2>Review： Journey to Launch Podcast Episode 335 with Persona of Ada Vargas</h2>
WOW.

This week Journey To Launch podcast host is the Persona of Jamila Souffrant guest is the persona of Ada Vargas.
Killed it.

THIS IS WORTH A SECOND LISTEN. DO IT.

'Episode 335: How To Coast Your Way To Financial Independence, Save 60% of Your Income & Reframe What Retirement Means w/ Ada Vargas'
<a href="https://journeytolaunch.com/episode335/">https://journeytolaunch.com/episode335/</a>

From the viewpoint of someone who grew up not knowing investing, no clue of how to retire with abundant funds.

Guest says when younger, she thought she would have to literally save every penny of money during working years, then spend those pennies down during her (their) retirement years.

And it resonates because I believed that for many decades too.

But not only that, this podcast guest makes like 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 incredibly on-point feelings / facts / perspectives on paradigms and paradigms-shifts, regarding money, saving, budgeting, money fears, etc. etc.

AGAIN I REPEAT. THIS IS WORTH A SECOND LISTEN. DO IT.

In conclusion, this episode 335 of Journey To Launch Podcast is excellent for the above reasons, and is worth a couple of listens!
