<h2>Distilling Goals 2023 December 31st</h2>
Distilling goals.

I.)
“Discipline is remembering what you want.”*.

So what do I want?
Hmm, let me think, ok, suddenly clear.


II.)
I want my basic yearly living expenses to be 1/2 my yearly income.

One more thing.


III.)
I ALSO want to be a 'pedigree daddy'**.

What's that mean?*
Well I assigned it this meaning but I say it means the dad and the mom each/both have enough income to pay for 100% of their family's expenses.

So there will be a bus factor so if one parent gets hit by a bus the family is still ok.
So also either/both parents is less fearing and less co-dependent so each person is independent which may make for healthier relationships based on wants not based on financial co-dependent needs/fears.
In other words if you have two parents in your family you're 200% covered, or if you have one parent in your family then you're still 100% covered.
If you are a young person supporting yourself then you are a pedigree young person and you have yourself 100% covered.

In conclusion, discipline is remembering what you want, I want my yearly income to be 2x my basic yearly living expenses, and I want to be a pedigree daddy.

** Well it really refers to the matt damon SNL sketch where the dads act like pedigree dogs in a dog show, but its a daddy show. And the daddys are more arrogant etc. but funny. From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S2gQjTURvU">Westminster Daddy Show - SNL</a>
