<h2>Distilling Goals 2023 December 31st</h2>
I.)  “Discipline is remembering what you want.”*.

So what do I want?
Hmm, let me think, ok, suddenly clear.

II.)  I want my basic yearly living expenses to be 1/2 my yearly income.

One more thing.

III.)  I ALSO want to be a 'pedigree daddy'**.

What's that mean? Well I assigned it this meaning but I say it means the dad and the mom each/both have enough income to pay for 100% of their family's expenses.
Higher bus factor, either both parents is less fearing and more independent, healthier relationships.
Envisioned if you are one person then you are a pedigree person and you have yourself 100% covered.

In conclusion, I.) discipline is remembering what you want, and II.) I want my yearly income to be 2x my basic yearly living expenses, and III.) I want to be a pedigree daddy.
