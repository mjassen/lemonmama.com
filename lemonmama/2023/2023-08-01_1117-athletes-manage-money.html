<h2>High Level Athletes Stories Managing Money</h2>
Four stories about athletes managing money.

Athlete money story 1 of 4:

First is a money athlete story that was amazing for me to hear.

In this UFC Fight night show, the announcers mention in passing, that Persona John Castaneda (going up against Persona Muin Gafurov tonight) works a full time job besides his MMA training schedule.

2023 june 3 'UFC Fight Night"
<a href="https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-fight-night-june-03-2023">https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-fight-night-june-03-2023</a>

Lemonmama note:
O. M. G. so inspiring.

And I admire Persona Castaneda and he inspires me for his work ethic and his personality and his smarts and his strength, from what I see so far.

But also I have so many questions about this.
Does this mean Persona Castaneda is, in terms of income coming in from the fighting, currently partly a hobbyist or an amateur?
What I mean by that is, does he's not (yet currently) earning enough direct money income from the prizes/pay from fighting to pay for all his life expenses currently?

Based only on what I heard from this show, it means that I don't know based on what i know so far, whether or not Persona Castaneda earns _anything_ income from fighting or not. 

In other words, if he fights, loses, or wins, is there any income money that he can get from that, or not? If so how much?

But it sounds like so far, that the income is very little or no income from the fighting.

simply amazing.

I get inspired and admire Persona Castaneda for his accomplishments.

But a question I have is the following; is the guy in a situation living paycheck to paycheck?

If the announcers say is true then the guy still works a job outside fighting, and I would assume he does in order to pay the bills, support life expenses, etc. etc.

amazing.

Over time I did also hear a few other stories about athletes who are dealing with money finances too. And so here are 3 more stories that I heard about this:

Athlete money story 2 of 4:

MMA cage fighting crew member, Persona Tristan Tate talks about, at one point, early on in his career, Tristan's brother Persona Andrew Tate didn't have a ton of money and so Andrew and Tristan worked together to get enough money together to cover the costs to allow Andrew to be able to continue focusing on training/developing/competing in his MMA fighting career. This video from Valuetainment PBD Podcast talks about this:

Athlete money story 3 of 4:

NFL football coach, Persona Frank Reich talks with Persona David Gardner how Reich got smarter with money:
"Football and Foolishness With Colts Head Coach Frank Reich"

Athlete money story 4 of 4:

NFL footbal athlete, Persona Teez Tabor and others talk with money coaches as Tabor manages his finances:
"Get Smart With Money"
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81312877">https://www.netflix.com/title/81312877</a>

In conclusion, these were four stories that are sometimes inspiring and worthy of admiration, however also full of challenges, emotions, problems, and solutions, in the context of high level athletes dealing with money and finance, and managing money.



[2023 update here is a fifth pro athlete story. Persona Sem Verbeek talks with Motley Fool host David Gardner about playing tennis professionally while at the same time striving for financial well being.
