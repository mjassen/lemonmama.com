<h2>Business Model Just F__ing Read Book Sell Arbitrary</h2>
Just f__ing read a copy of the book then sell it for an arbirary amount.

ok so here is a new business model.

I will keep buying copies of these 6x books.

then I will read the copy.

then I will blog an update on new meditations and thoughts on reading that exact copy of the book.

then I will post that exact copy of the book for sale on ebay.

like an autographed copy. one of a kind. 

and then i'll charge a marked-up price for it.

it's arbitrary.

but up to the buyer to decide to buy it.

but life's arbitrary.

and I am asking a price that I make up out of thin air.

and I am providing value in the form of a copy of the book, and I am providing added value in terms of i read that book and I post a blog update of it.

so win win win.
(if someone buys it then it means they value that so they are winning too)

These 6x books:

1. Your Money or Your Life
2. The Richest Man in Babylon
3. Rich Dad Poor Dad
4. The Millionaire Next Door
5. Rich Woman
6. I Got Bank!

that's it.

In conclusion, Just f__ing read a copy of the book then sell it for an arbirary amount.
