<h2>Cat Game</h2>
Cat game is an online game, and it is about feeding your cats.
Basically, you have a cat tower, and the more levels you unlock, the higher your tower gets. For example, I am level 3, so I have 3 floors on my tower.
The regular cats:

The fancy cats:

And the posh cats:

If one of my cats gets hungry, then I feed it. For example, right now, my Siamese cat, Simon, is demanding golden caviar. So, I have to feed him that.

If I feed him, than I can choose to deliver a basket. It could either have a new cat to adopt, or materials to build furniture for the cats.
Ok, I‚Äôm going to spin it.

I got cotton! Now I can build things like rugs and curtains for the cats.
That is basically how the game works, and I like it because I love cats, and this game is really cute and fun. Plus, I have been playing for 1 day, and it has only given me 1 ad. Crazy, right? Have fun playing! ü§© üêà üß∫!!!
