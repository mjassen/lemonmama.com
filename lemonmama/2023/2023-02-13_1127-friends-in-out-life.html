<h2>Learn How To Let Friends Go In And Out Of My Life</h2>
I need to learn how to let friends go in and out of my life.

That's all.

And the best way to do something, is to do it.

So do it.

Just let friends go in and out of my life on a regular basis. 

Like with the seasons.

Like seasons of life.

Maybe some friendships last a year.

Maybe some friendships last a month.

Maybe some friendships never happen (enemies from the first moment).

Maybe some friendships last a lifetime.

Maybe some friendships come and go with the times. They may trail off for months or years and then come back.

In contrast historically I had feared the coming and going of relationships. As if any friendship had to be awesome and never ending.

But that's not realistic.
That's more hollywood feel.

The way the world works is, each person has many friends, and each friendship relationship is at a different season of ebbing or flowing.
