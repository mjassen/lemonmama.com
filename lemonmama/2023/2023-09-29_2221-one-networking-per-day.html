<h2>Notes How To Have One Professional Networking Meeting Per Day</h2>
So I told myself I'll have one meeting per day.

MJ Career Blog #003 for 2023 Week 30
<a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-07-24_2256-mj-career-blog-003.html">https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-07-24_2256-mj-career-blog-003.html</a>

However.

It feels like, I'm just going thorugh the motions not making many deep connections.

It seems I'm still not able to really build the level of long term trust I need to get above minimum wage in my life and my career.

So, ... why is that?...

Well my immediate answer is likely because 'you get out what you put in' with networking groups and meetings. (and with life).

And so since I a basically showing up to networking groups and events and doing the bare minimum.

Thus what I am getting out of networking events and meetings is also the bare minimum.

At least that's not nothing.

Ok so now I want to work my way 1% 1% 1% week by week by week to get more professional.

And so i thinkk what's needed is... .... is... ... i don't know.

I feel like it'll be some strong effort or some different effort.

or some smarter effort.

do I need to rest more? rest differently?

jump between tasks quicker? jump betwen tasks differently?

do different tasks?

leave out more unnecessary tasks?

add in more necessary tasks?

make decisions quicker?

make a smarter plan? 

make a simpler plan?

execute my plan more ruthlessly?

be more calm and cool while executing my plan?

be more open to changing my plan mid-flow if needed?

be less open to changing my plan mid-flow if needed?

get help frome more quantity of different colleagues?

double down on asking for help from the same small handful of colleagues, more often?

heads down work by myself to make large leaps in projects myself more quickly?

amazing.
so many moving parts.

and so little clarity it seems.

and I don't know the answer, don't know to press forward hard and find someone and ask them to 1:1 meeting or whether to re-write my plan, or whether to go take a nap.

moving on.

In conclusion, ok i will double down on talking with my current colleagues, and find how I can help them. So i will ask for meetings with PEOPLE. I. ALREADY. KNOW.
