<h2>What Percentage to Pay Property Manager Maybe</h2>
This is short and sweet.

I heard someone publish what percentage they pay their property manager.

And that information is gold for me as a noob to real estate investing.

So as a rule of thumb, I may use this as an initial starting point if I need to get into property management business.

Link to the podcast episode:
"Why Owning Rental Properties Is Both Bad And Good For Your Health"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-financial-samurai-podcast/id1324765509?i=1000590009743">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-financial-samurai-podcast/id1324765509?i=1000590009743</a>

Before the 12m.36s. mark of the podcast episode, the host the persona of Sam Dogen, mentions for one of his rental propperties he pays a property manager 25% of the rental income as commission to manage the property. 

Lemon Mama note: thanks for sharing what % percentage !!!



In conclusion, it's excellent to have at least a basic rule of thumb starting point, to know what percentage of rental income may be suitable to go to the property manager!
