<h2>This Picture Is Epic</h2>
Ok this picture is epic.

it has been the picture on the home page of <a href="https://fidelityrewards.com">https://fidelityrewards.com</a> for many years now.

And it seems like a simple photo maybe.

However I think it is quite special picture.

The photo manages to fit in all of the following:
- vacation fun 
- family fun
- woman in bathing suit
- outdoors/kayaking
- man/dad independent and aloof (so manly american man)

What a very white American picture.

Huh.

And also not to miss the fact that the dad seems to be off having fun in his kayak where the mom seems to be the one taking care of the kids.
So there's a bit of a 1950's/60's white patriarchy feel here.

Anyways the more times I see this picture the more interesting it gets. But I see more and more how carefully planned this photo/picture must have been. And perhaps why it was kept so long on this home page, it's a very attractive picture in many ways, maybe especially to people who aspire to be a white american family.

I think the picture was photoshopped, but I can't really tell or not. If they actually staged a single real photograph with the three people aligned like that etc. then kudos to them. However I'd bet 95% sure the kayak dad guy / background was photoshopped in.

Of course I noticed these things are all unrelated directly per se to a credit card which is what the homepage is for. The folks in the picture aren't directly currently using their credit card, they're out and about in nature. 
However As I blogged before, marketing doesn't need to be <a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-07-16_1226-anything-marketing-not-related.html">"Anything Marketing Not Related to Anything"</a>.

Anyways, I also saw this home page wasn't saved in archive.org. Otherwise I would have linked to the archive.org page here.

In conclusion, this picture is epic.
