<h2>Ask Folks to an In Person Meeting</h2>
Make sure to ask folks for FACE. TO. FACE. MEETINGS.

For example a colleague.

Or a recruiter.

This applies to 1000x helping_pros networking 1-on-1 meetings.

Bearing down on face-to-face being my personal differentiator.

It is what sets me apart from others. 

I ask for face-to-face meetings.

Why? I'ts arbitrary. It's my differentiator.

However at the same time I need this. 

I need to personally up my communication abilites. 

And I believe that humans use 90% body-language / facial-expressions to communicate. 

And therefore this is what I need and this is my differentiator.

Also.

Face-to-face meeting easy to rule out AI interactions quickly.

Phone calls would also able to rule out AI too.

Whereas email wouldn't rule out AI as quickly nor would chat nor would ATS application.
