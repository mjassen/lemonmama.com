<h2>Losing to AI’s since ’95</h2>
Ok I have been playing against AIs since 1995 when i played 'super mario brothers' on nes and since 1987 and 1990 when I played 'punch out' on nes vs computer for example vs. 'the computer' characters like vs. 'von kaiser' and 'don flamenco' and 'king hippo' on nes punch out.
this is so cool,

Because in 2023 folks say ai whoah coo so powerful.
And we were playint these games since 1985, 1987, 1990. so its interesing.

also scary.

In conclusion, by playing mario and punch out, we've been losing to the AI's since 1995.
