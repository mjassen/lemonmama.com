<h2>Inspiring Quote About Liberal Abundant Wealth </h2>

Regarding the idea of liberal abundant wealth.

'...
It reminds me of 'the richest man in babylon' and specifically this excerpt describes how someone can seemingly have a type of wealth that seems is abundant:
(the very start of chapter 2) 
"...In old Babylon there once lived a certain very rich man named Arkad. Far and wide he was famed for his great wealth. Also was he famed for his liberality. He was generous in his charities. He was generous with his family. He was liberal in his own expenses. But nevertheless each year his wealth increased more rapidly than he spent it. "...

so actually interesting. in a copy of the book i had, the quote of arkad is from the very start of chapter 2. However the same quote, the same chapter, is from the very start of chapter 3 in the archive.org copy of the book. So here is the direct link to that page of the book on archive.org. Note in any case the name of the chapter is called "The Richest Man in Babylon" (same name as the book). Here is the link to the chapter as seen on archive.org:

<a href="https://archive.org/details/richestmaninbaby0000geor_q8e2/page/20/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/rich ... estmaninbaby0000geor_q8e2/page/20/mode/2up</a>


In conclusion, the idea of inspiring liberal abundant wealth lives on including in this quote.
