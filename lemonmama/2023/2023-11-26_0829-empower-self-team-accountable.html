<h2>Empower by Holding Self and Team Accountable</h2>
~
My 5-10 YEAR GOALS are:

1.) 
Learn to do every job role in my company, including eventually part-COO & part-CEO & part-CFO. In other words be trained up to do these roles or cover for these roles, even if they aren't my current role.

2.) 
Become, and maintain, part-owner status in the company.


~
Here's a script to empower myself and my colleagues.

Even thought I am entry level associate.

First, I am afraid of getting fired*, because I need a paycheck.

And so but I still need to hold myself, my team, and my boss accountable.

As If I was part owner of the company.

So if I see myself, or my team, or my boss, doing something that needs optimizing or isn't productive, or if I see something needs improvement. Like process improvement needed to add something or take something away to improve the business. Then, I need to immediately tell myself that and tell my team that and tell my boss that.

Ok but if i'm frozen afraid to speak truth to power, then i need a safety net where I can keep on my feet immediately even if I get fired for speaking truth to power.

Note that my mind tells me that only 5% chance most folks including myself, including at any company i worked at, would get fired for speaking truth to power as long as it's reasonable and well thought out and well presented.
However it feels the opposite in my fear/heart often, my spiraling scarcity fear is often that i feel in my heart (not think in my head) that i would have a 95% chance of getting fired if I speak truth to power. And heart/fear is very real so it's hard to get past that. So i need to feel a safety net in order to get past that and follow my mind which is more likely correct and accurate..

My safety net is to list 3 or more companies where i'd immeditately apply for a new job if I ever got fired from my current job.

Organizations that one may possibly apply for a job in 2023, depending on factors:

Wendy's 
Market Basket 
Ace Hardware
Panera Bread
________Other cool company name here)____________

Ok cool. so now i have my safety net. If i lose my job then' i'll immediately apply for new entry level job same-day or next-day. 
all set.

moving on.
empowering.

next now I immediately in my mind and thoughts and speech and actions, start acting like a part-owner of my company.
And any time I see any process improvement needed for myself or my team or my boss, then i think to tell myself/team/boss that.
And I do tell myself/team/boss that.

And that's it.

As long as It is reasonable and well thought out and well presented, i think this will be a win win win for everybody.

And also i don't think i'll actually end up needing my safety net either. but it'll be there jsut in case.

And finally, most importantly, sincee I'll more be speaking truth to power and moving towards process improvement, then, now, I'll also be getting closer step by step to my goals (1. and 2. above) because I'll 
1.) be acting aligned with improving process for all roles in the company that I can see/touch, and I'll also 
2.) be acting aligned with acting like a part-owner of the company

nice.

In conclusion, in order to learn roles in my company and move towards part-ownership feel of my company, I will first get a safety net and then speak truth to power ongoing reasonably and then I'll be an empowering force within my company for myself and my team and my boss ongoing in a win-win-win fashion.
