<h2>Podcast Episode Review: Teenagers are Saavy and Sheeksfreaks Dan is Transparent About Real Estate Investments</h2>
Love this episode for a couple of reasons.

"How To Be a Future Millionaire: Teaching Gen Z About Financial Freedom, & Letting Go Of The American Dream With Dan Sheeks"
(Journey To Launch podcast with Jamila Souffrant)
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-to-launch/id1257126028?i=1000583935241">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-to-launch/id1257126028?i=1000583935241</a>

1.)
At the ~33 minute mark or just before thereabouts, the podcast guest gives props to today’s teenagers for actually being very savvy about determining what’s real and what’s fake on Instagram or Snapchat or social media.
He says like you know what I’ve seen teenagers on social media and they can actually have a pretty good discernment of when it’s a fancy car a fancy watch or fancy clothes or vacation they they have an idea that that’s usually can be fake often and it’s not the whole story that are seeing.

Lemon Mama's note: Yes I love this. Someone is actually giving teenagers props for being smart in the current day.

2.)
At about the ~40 minute mark the guest the Persona of Dan from Sheeksfreaks.com says he doesn’t mind being transparent about his own investments including some basic numbers. 
And then, like she does, the host Jamila calls him out on it. Immediately. 

Lemon Mama's note on this is ha ha yes! Nice accountability!

And then, even better, and props to the guest Dan, he does indeed then immediately follow through and says yes I have a $5 million portfolio 17 real estate units, 2 million is my partner's, 3 million is mine and my wife’s, and of the 3 million, 1.5 million is equity and 1.5 million is leveraged debt.

Lemon Mama's note is, thank you for being transparent and thanks for Jamila for calling him out on it and thanks to him for following through on that! 



In conclusion, if folks want to learn more about financial freedom and being saavy about real wealth vs. fake wealth, and learning about some real examples of how a real estate investment portfolio looks, and more, then I'd recommend you to listen to this episode!
