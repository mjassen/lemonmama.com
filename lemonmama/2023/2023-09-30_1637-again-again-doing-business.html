<h2>Keep Talking Again and Again With Professionals Whom I'm Already Doing Business</h2>
At midnight, I finish writing my most recent blog draft.

A plan how to sell t-shirts made in USA.

I lay down to sleep.

A owl screeches outside and my eyes open.

The question at this moment is:

How to methodically grow into a compamy and succeed?

Is that I blogged a draft about it before.

Pattern:
Any place where I shop and spend money.
Next time I am there.
Any time I am there.
Every time.
I see an employee.
I ask them what they think about working there, ask them if they will meet me 20m. for networking meeting.
If they say ok then I meet them.
That's it really.
And so if I end up doing this 100 times per year, then I may have 5-10 informational interviews from it.
And these are legit because in each case I am literally already a customer.
The end.
That's all.


A few extra notes in story/example form:
Next time I'm in CVS pharmacy in my town.
I say hi to the clerk and ask them how is it working there.
If they bite then I become friends then I chat and eventally ask them to 20m. netwokring meeting.
If they don't bite I'm not their friend and no more conversation, the lead goes cold. (Heck then I may even stop patronizing that store or at least that branch. Or not.)
Same for CVS for the next town over.
Same for Starbucks the next town over.
Same for my current store/branch where I work now. Yeah, my own store Isn't exempt, is applicable to the same rules.
Next is Walmart three towns over.
Next is Target three towns over.
Next is Wendys next town over.
Next is Wendys three towns over.
Next is TJ Maxx next town over.
Next is Marshalls Four towns over.
Next is Sierra four towns over.
Next is BJ's Wholesale three towns over.

BTW I am still partial to public companies. Can you tell? 

And so then say I go into any next company.

And it is because I met a networker who was willing to chat with me for 20 minutes repeatedly and we became friends and we hit it off.

Then my next move.

Is I keep talking INSIDE that company to all employee and vendors. Ask them about their job. what it is like. Ask them how is it working there. Make friends. 

Eventually I will make friends with some higher manger. Then higher manager. Then vendor company jump sideways. Then manager. Then higher manager.
Sometimes start over. No matter. Work my way up again.
Friends with manager again.
Then friends with higher manager. Then higher manager.
Then eventually make friends with part-owner of some company or other.
Then eventallly I organically worked my way up, 20 minutes conversation at at time.


In other words. I start off as a customer, then an employee, all the while keeping having more conversations as customer and as employee.

Then I am having customer and employee and manager conversations. Keep networking.

Then some day customer and employee and manager and director conversations. Keep networking.
Then eventually customer and employee and manager and director and owner conversations. Keep networking.

And so this way, organically, get to know owners. Finally.
And did it by being friendly and professional and daily talking to people WHO I ALREADY AM DOING BUSINESS WITH. And so it is a warm conversation starter every time. Because I'm already there in a business capacity every time anyway.

1% 1% 1%

The End.
