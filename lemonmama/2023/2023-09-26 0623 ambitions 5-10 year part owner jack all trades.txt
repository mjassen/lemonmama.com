Here's what I am starting to say now when it's time to tell my ambitions to others:


"...
* My five to ten year goal is to be a part owner of the company.

* I want to eventually be able to do all the roles inside the company with basic proficiency.

* I'm a 'jack of all trades (master of none)', and have been for as long as I can remember.
..."


Why am I starting to folks these sentences as my goals statement? 

I believe that this is an acceptable answer to almost anyone that I meet or work with, notably including my direct managers and colleagues, because:

- It shows long term thinking. 5-10 years shows patience and dedication, not greed.

- Colleagues may be less threatened I want their job because they see I want to do ALL the roles in the company. It shows curiosity and it shows dedication within the company. And a desire to learn and meet folks inside the company. And work ethic.

- I say "PART owner" instead of owner, which shows I want to share I can share and leaves room for others to share too.

- However the fact that i say part owner also shows that I want some ownership stake. It shows I desire responsibility and ownership, that means I am a driven professional person.

Finally, I also am wanting my colleagues to also have similar ambitions, if they want to themselves. One way is to tell them of my goals and ambitions, then they can see I am a role model. Another way is to follow up on that and work in alignment with that and report to them afterwards what I did so far for that. A third way is to check on a colleague and tell them what I saw as their performance and tell them to what degree that aligns with these goals or not too.

In conclusion, I'm starting to tell everyone who wants to know, or should know, that the above sentences are my goals and ambitions in terms of career, business, and life, and, I am also trying to push up on (in a good way) my colleagues to have similar noble lofty ambitions too.
