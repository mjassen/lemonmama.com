START

Being a protégé means I consider ideas from mentors and I am accountable for my own development around these ideas.

~ 1.) Protégé under Persona David Gardner:
He comes across as humble and he comes across as being on my side, wanting me to be able to have a better life.
And so listening to his podcast over more than a year, his consistent messages were buy and hold good companies, don't try to play the trading game, and maybe never selling your companies.

On the Motley Fool Rule Breaker Investing Podcast, over many months and years, persona Gardner repeatedly drove home this idea that a good way to invest is to find a good company, and to buy and hold that company for as many years as possible, ideally for decades, and don't sell it for frivolous reasons.

So I researched pepsico and decided presonally myself it was a good company.
I'm a protégé under Persona Gardner because i considered his ideas, decided for myself to follow them and how to follow them, and then I actually did go an follow them.

~ 2.) Protégé under Persona George Clason:

And I come upon the work of persona George Clason. And Clason teaches that '1/10 of all that I earn is mine to keep' but that not all that I earn is mine to keep.
This is humble because it says you can't keep 90% of what you earn you have to share that.
To me this gives the idea credibility.
But also I like the idea it also empowers me because it says I get to keep 10% for myself to make my own life better.
And so I become a protégé under persona Clason. I consider Clason's ideas and hold myself accountable to take action and now the amount of my paycheck i use to invest 

And so but before I listened to Clason's ideas I wasn't sure, where to get money to invest, nor how much money to invest. 
And persona Clason repeatedly drove home the message in his book, that a proper amount to invest can be 1/10 of what one earns, 1/10 of each of one's paychecks.
and so over the months, from 1/10 of my paychecks, was how i was now in 2023, after about 3 paychecks, I was able to buy 1 share of PepsiCo.

And so persona Clason is my mentor and I am Clason's protege.

~ 3.) Protégé under persona Robert Kiyosaki:
I already know I am trapped in paycheck-to-paycheck life because I can feel it every day. I feel that my earnings just about equal my spending, and my savings rate is pretty low and pretty static.
But I don't know how to change this and what can be done to be have some hope ever some day of not having to work paycheck-to-paycheck.
And then I come across teachings of persona Robert Kiyosaki.
And he describes my situation exactly even though he never met me. 
And he has a word for it he calls it "the rat race". and he repeatedly says over and over and over again the following ideas in his book and podcast:
- find other income other than just working for a paycheck
- business ownership may be a good source of income that is not from an employee working for a paycheck.
And I become a protégé under persona Robert Kiyosaki. I consider Kiyosaki's ideas.
I consider buying assets where it returns money in the form of profits or dividends or returns, not in the form of a paycheck.

And now I still am thinking each week on new ways what different incomes can I buy or create.

So I heard his message loud and clear, and i bought something that I believed will net flow cash to me, which for myslef now in my case is 1 share of PepsiCo stock.

~ 4.) Protégé under persona Jamila Souffrant:
Persona Souffrant 
- interviews folks who are all trying to get control of their life and their finances
- interviews folks who are trying different things.

I already know I want to learn more about money and investing and having a rich life.
But sometimes my inspiration grows weary or I feel like hearing new stories or different approaches.

And I become a protégé under persona Jamil Souffrant. I consider Souffrant's ideas.

And she keeps on interviewing people who are trying different ways to be financially free, one, after another, after another, after another, seeminly non stop.

She and her guests tell stories about:
-Debt
- Investing
- Business
- life
- family
- budgeting
- career
- real estate

Now as a protege of persona Souffrant, I am holding myself accountable to always find new and different ways to get different incomes and regulate my expenses differently.

~ 5.) Protégé under persona Vicki Robin.
I also considered Vicki Robin's ideas. In chapter 6 of "your money Or Your Life" Robin & co. define what is "frugal" and one meaning is getting good use out of material possessions, not starving or restricting yourself uncomfortably, but rather deliberately sharing and using and especially enjoying what you have, NOT hedonism NOT excess NOT overspending.

And persona Robin also came on persona Souffrant's podcast and so I got to hear them talking together. Great perspective.

And so now I consider, how to get the most of what I have and make material possessions go a long way. 

And so because I am considering Robin's ideas and considering how to make them work for me, I am her protege and she is my mentor.

~
In conclusion, I am the protege of these 5 personas who are my mentors. Because I consider their ideas and I hold myself accountable to implement these ideas myself, thus I take the role of protege here.
Thank you toastmaster.
