<h2>#0014 - Someone Who Demands to be Treated Unique</h2>

Some people want to be seen by others as associated with other people, grouped together and by association sharing some of the associated status (or anti-status) of that group of people.

Some people have a burning desire to be seen as unique and independent, one of a kind, one in a trillion.

The more pondered, the more examples there are of this.

But take fashion.

Some people have a burning desire to wear their garments and style to be unlike that of any other person.

Other people don't want that, they rather wear a style that is similar to some other people, for example similar to their friends.

When I meet a person who wants to be considered as different, I know it because something they are presenting to me, is unlike the other people I see.

When I see such a person, I can feel a vibe that says like, 'don't treat me like other people, i went to trouble to present and act differently like no one else, so please treat me as a unique person'

This in comparison to a lot of people I meet, who have a shared style that seems to me has been done or worn before.

In the end, every person on earth is different, in different ways.

However some people are demanding to be perceived as different.

Whereas some people aren't particularly demanding this.

However in hindsight, I believe that in some arena of life or another, and at some chapter of their life or other, each and every earthling does at some point insist on others seeing their uniqueness.
