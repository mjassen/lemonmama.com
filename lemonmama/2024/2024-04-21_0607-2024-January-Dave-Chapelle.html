<h2>Dear “2024 January Dave Chapelle”，</h2>
Some of my heroes podcasters responded to my messages over the years and months.

Maybe they did so because they are hungry dreaming for people to listen to their content.

I blogged for myself.

Maybe it's time to blog to reply to others' people's content now more.

Sometimes people dream about big things and can't find local folks who want to listen.

So publishing to a wider audience connects people with folks who want to listen.

In this blog post, you are in my dream.

Thanks for this comedy special, I laughed hard at some of your jokes.

It was good.

When I watched it, I was in your dream.

Regards,

“2024 January Morgan Jassen”
