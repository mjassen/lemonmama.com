2024-02-15 1606  -  ₷¤3.65 Silver Bams is Now ₷1 Shell
 
Ok so this idea of ₷¤365 silver bams* I've evolved it over the years.
So its still cumbersome.
So now another iteration.

I'll now say:
₷ Ye Olden Shells (shells for short)

Also I'll probably drop the 365 per year idea and instead just say 100 per year.
And drop the ¤ (currency sign) and just keep only the ₷ (spesmilo) because they're pretty much rudundant anyways and the latter is more fitting.

So example:
 
BEFORE:
I say folks should be surfing ₷¤730 silver bams per year!

AFTER:
I say folks should be surfing ₷200 Ye Olden Shells per year!

Finally, what is the new calculation?

- In 2023 it is still true that folks generall spend what they earn and so average income equals average expenses.
-- 'World gdp per capita for 2022 was $12,647'
https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/gdp-per-capita
--- So in december 2023, i'll say that    (₷100 Ye Olden Shells)  =  ($12,647 dollars)

In conclusion, ₷¤3.65 silver bams is now ₷1 shell.
