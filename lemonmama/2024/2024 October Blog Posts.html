Weird Learning Failing Past Frustration

It's a weird feeling.

Learning you are failing at something.

But the weirder part is learning at the exact same time.

That you've been failing at that same thing for about 20 years.

And it's frustrating at first.

But it gets real weird when you get past the frustration.

And realize.

Now I am aware of my failure.

This time I failed and I know it.

Whereas I before every week for 20 years, I had been failing at the same thing and didn't know it.

So now I have the power to not fail at that anymore.

Feels good.

Once you get past that frustration.

Now I can recognize that failure as a pattern.

Now I can start to succeed at this.

UFC Paradigm Shift Especially With Mcgregor Vs. Diaz Notes

watched more fights. 3rd month-long subscription ended of espn+.

one thing i learned especially after the very last one where i watched video of Conor McGregor fighting Nate Diaz, these are characters.

And in this fight they were fighting to win this fight, not just to last 5 rounds. Each wanted to choke/knock the other out.
Also I had previously seen video of EACH of these fighter and so i remembered examples of how tough and gritty and smart each was.

Each one at this point was a champion and elite and amazing. 
And so in the end a champion elite amazing fighter would lose this fight.

More notes: each/both was really on their game in this fight it seemed. Quick, hungry, trained up endurance seemed.

And these characters it seems were both mentally ruthless and taunting.

One thing it seemed to me that, instead of being insulted or offended by McGregor's taunts, Diaz it seemed to me actually fed off of them. Which to me seemed unique becuase in my experience McGregor had usually been able to get under most other opponents' skin with his words, but in this case it seemed not so.

But interesting was watching McGregor getting beaten so badly. I thought he mentally and physically didn't care that he was getting beaten nor wobbly. It seemed to me that even bruised and wobbly he only stayed focused on how he might still win this fight. And then down on the ground he, and they both, scrambled with extreme quickness. 

And so it seems the fight came down to, among other things like skill training etc, fight came down to luck in some ways. 

But interesting after the fight McGregor seemed humble. Not embarrassed, not upset, just humble. As if he was literally learning from this experience how to do better his next time, right before our eyes.




watched about 8x fight night videos this time through. iirc:

UFC 196      (Mar 2016)        'UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz'                 fin.
UFC 195      (JAN 2016)        'UFC 195: Lawler vs. Condit'                fin.

UFC 189      (JUL 2015)        "UFC 189: Mendes vs. McGregor"


-
side note totally unrelated:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nate_Diaz&oldid=1220880090
IN ^this wikipedia article it said in passing Diaz at one point signed an 8 fight contract with the UFC.
Mo note: wow. so fighers may sign a multiple-fight-long contract with UFC / Dana White?
Good to know.
So because this is more the business side but also more the dedication/motivational/loyalty side too. 
So this could affect fighters in a good way, or in a bad way. Because maybe they are doing well to aspire to get a contract and finish the contract and win another contract etc. 
But on the other hand could affect in a bad way, what if they don't want to fight but feel compelled to do so just because of the contract.

UFC 196 Notes

'UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz' was full of some great fights!

'UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz' | https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/153d6433-45ff-4253-bf69-c54bc25f0c56

SPOILER ALERT THIS POST TELLS WHO WON SOME OF THE FIGHTS.
SO GO WATCH THIS FIGHT TICKET FIRST IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILER!!!!

first I saw:
Women's Bantamweight 	Amanda Nunes 	def. 	Valentina Shevchenko

then I saw:

anderson vs. lawler

and these are f*in g crazy fights.
they are doin' it to it.

Amanda Nunes vs. Valentina Shevchenko
brazilian  vs. kyrgyzstani-peruvian.

wow. apparently there is a wikipedia page of individuals who moved from kyrgyzstani people who moved to peru:
'Kyrgyzstani people of Ukrainian descentKyrgyzstani emigrants to Peru'
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Kyrgyzstani_people_of_Ukrainian_descent

and persona Valentina is among them.
wow. i just looked at map. Kyrgyzstan is a country apparently. i had no idea. there is so much geography between russia and china and india. and even kazakhstan and afghanistan. not to mention iran and tajikstan and uzbekistan. these are all real places independent of each other in 2024. and Kyrgyzstan is one of them. and i got into this rabbit hole beauae of this ufc fight. nice.

not to mention, holm vs. tate is f** crazy now beginning of round 3. theyaare carzy.

ok fing crazy.
persona of miesha tate chokes persona of holly holm in round 5/5 of the fight.
and then mo note: tate is actually concerned, the judges have to motion tate to stand back while they wait to revive holm. 
seems tate wnat to see whether the opponenet is ok or not after choking/knocking them out, physically kneels down about 10 feeet away from the body of holm waiting for judges/refs/doctors to see if/when holm revives. 

mo note: so amazing. 
holm taps just before she sleeps.
and this is a vicious yet somehow classy fight.

mo note: i'm literally dropping tears crying quietly here its' inspirign.

wow.
then persona nate diaz chokes out persona conor macgegor.
and they boxed and they finally wrestled.
and then diaz wins.
and in the end interview macgregor says '... humble in victory and humble in defeat...'
amazing.
good fight.
but diaz did seem to do so well in boxing and in fighting and in grappling.

In Conclusion, 'UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz' was full of some great fights, because they were inspiring, if you are UFC fan I do recommend watching this fight ticket.

Slow Not Lazy But Rather Economical

Here's a value that I bring to the table.

I'm slow.

Not in a lazy way.

In a deliberate, economical way.

2024-06-04 1944 school is a turd fest.txt

Love this scene.

Mary: '...how's school?...'
Georgie: '...it's school. ... It's a turd fest...'

Love it because Georgie's not wrong.

In some ways, school is a turd fest.

The character of Georgie is in many ways consistent throughout the seasons of this TV series.
Georgie drops out of high school.
He is good at sales.
He runs his own business.

The Rational Male book Is Legit But Brutal

2024-06-04 1621 The Rational Male book prefaced by PBD Podcast episode.txt

I finally reading this book.

But the key is.

The key is, that I FIRST saw, and heard, the persona Rollo Tomassi appear on PBD podcast.

And that is KEY.

Becuause I first saw/heard him longform interview, thus, i first saw how he presented, and in my opinion I saw that he was very articulate and very mature and yes even very humble, he presented his ideas and himself.

And so i was able to decide myself that he is legit.

And also his ideas as well. Legit.

Then when my friends and family were discussing banned books and fringe books.

And that got me excited because ANOTHER THING about this book is it's not technically a book as some people would define.

I couldn't find it in my local public libraries.  

I only found it self-published by the author's organization, via Amazon.com self-publishing platform.

Side note:
There are grammar mistakes every few pages or so.
Lol.
That doesn't matter.
That's not the point.
The book is mostly reprinted blog posts from therationalmale.com. It probably has those errors too. 
Not the point.
It's still legit.


Now I read 1 chapter already.

And I do still/further think it's legit.

But here's where I first ran into the persona of Rollo Tomassi and heard of the book The Rational Male:


"The Rational Male: Rollo Tomassi | PBD Podcast | EP 124" (feb 2022)
https://open.spotify.com/episode/2MacX7PyWE03b0anaOS0k8



Disclaimers:
Even in the first two chapters, the book ideas are psychologically brutal and psychologically ruthless. And yet the presentation and the ideas are, even at the same times and at some times candid, honest, articulate, mature, and/or even humble.
The author presenting these ideas is often bringing a sense of being frank, using candor, speaking truth to power, speaking truth, telling it like it is, etc. etc.
However at times it is so blunt and sometimes cold in its truth, that I can see how this book might be painful to some people.
I don't know why but I think it's because growing up in the particular rural area that I did, in the particular geography and time period and culture that I did, I was exposed, even if unknowingly and/or naturally and/or subconsciously, to many of these ideas when I grew up as a boy of ages about 3-20, including in elementary school and middle school and high school, and other areas of my life, family, friends, relationships, experience, and cultural exposure, when growing up in my formative years.
And so, it turns out, for me personally, when the author Tomassi tells different stories, defines terms, and talks ideas and examlples, I am being brought back decades in my own history  in my own mind and heart and soul and experience as I read these, and I am feeling that in hindsight I did touch many of these paradigms before.
And not only that, though, I also see other ideas he is presenting where I still have avoided them or seen but not engaged with tnem. 
So I think I can learn other new things, either what not to do, or what to do better, by reading this.
But man, by the way, I need to take frequent breaks when reading this book myself personally too. As this is really deep, raw, stuff, and so I'm not taking it lightly, and I feel I shouldn't be taking it lightly. Which takes some effort and meditating and time and digestion of the ideas.

If the above interests you, then maybe this book is for you too. 
If the above doesn't interest you, then maybe this book isn't for you or maybe think about it and consider it again later.

2024-06-04 “Ye Olden Pirate Budget” is Born.txt

i just dreamt this.

I hereby Invent what I am calling “Ye Olden Pirate Budget”.

It henceforth is born, and it is like this:

One document that describes incomes and expenses for three years out.

In a word, it could be called a budget.

However in my dream it is more than that.

In my dream it is the FEELING that is special when I make and use and feel this my special budget.

I feel like calling it "Ye Olden Pirate Budget" or something.

Because envisioned I write down ahead of time, 3 years out, where every penny will come from and where every penny will go to.

And at the same time, 3 years out, I make this plan.

And, the way in which I make this plan is such that there is more than enough money to cover a full thriving abundant experience-rich life.

And so then this makes me feel good.

I feel good to make a plan, including money sources and money destinations, that accounts for a fullfilling life.

And so let me go write this document right away.

And then let me live it.

If needed I'll edit the document.

And then I'll live it.

Then I'll keep editing and living according to this my 'Ye Olden Pirate Budget'.

And all the while I'll be living a life that is constantly full, thriving, abundant, experience-rich, and fulfilling.

And I'll have more than enough money while I'm doing this throughout.


Prediction 1:
One thing I predict this will mean is it will need to be a realistic budget and also I'll need to have self-discipline to stick to the budget or else realistically adjust it. Then again stick to it or again realistically re-adjust it.

Prediction 2:
A second thing I predict this will mean will be that I'll need to make effort to maintain good relationships and good boundaries with friends and family in my life, especially where money is involved, especially in order to stick to this my 'Ye Olden Pirate Budget'. Because my budget affects my friends and their budgets affect me. I will need to either stick to my budget when in comes to my friends, or else realistically re-adjust my budget when it comes to my friends, ongoing.

Fin.
