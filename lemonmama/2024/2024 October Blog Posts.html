Slow Not Lazy But Rather Economical

Here's a value that I bring to the table.

I'm slow.

Not in a lazy way.

In a deliberate, economical way.

2024-06-04 1944 school is a turd fest.txt

Love this scene.

Mary: '...how's school?...'
Georgie: '...it's school. ... It's a turd fest...'

Love it because Georgie's not wrong.

In some ways, school is a turd fest.

The character of Georgie is in many ways consistent throughout the seasons of this TV series.
Georgie drops out of high school.
He is good at sales.
He runs his own business.

The Rational Male book Is Legit But Brutal

2024-06-04 1621 The Rational Male book prefaced by PBD Podcast episode.txt

I finally reading this book.

But the key is.

The key is, that I FIRST saw, and heard, the persona Rollo Tomassi appear on PBD podcast.

And that is KEY.

Becuause I first saw/heard him longform interview, thus, i first saw how he presented, and in my opinion I saw that he was very articulate and very mature and yes even very humble, he presented his ideas and himself.

And so i was able to decide myself that he is legit.

And also his ideas as well. Legit.

Then when my friends and family were discussing banned books and fringe books.

And that got me excited because ANOTHER THING about this book is it's not technically a book as some people would define.

I couldn't find it in my local public libraries.  

I only found it self-published by the author's organization, via Amazon.com self-publishing platform.

Side note:
There are grammar mistakes every few pages or so.
Lol.
That doesn't matter.
That's not the point.
The book is mostly reprinted blog posts from therationalmale.com. It probably has those errors too. 
Not the point.
It's still legit.


Now I read 1 chapter already.

And I do still/further think it's legit.

But here's where I first ran into the persona of Rollo Tomassi and heard of the book The Rational Male:


"The Rational Male: Rollo Tomassi | PBD Podcast | EP 124" (feb 2022)
https://open.spotify.com/episode/2MacX7PyWE03b0anaOS0k8



Disclaimers:
Even in the first two chapters, the book ideas are psychologically brutal and psychologically ruthless. And yet the presentation and the ideas are, even at the same times and at some times candid, honest, articulate, mature, and/or even humble.
The author presenting these ideas is often bringing a sense of being frank, using candor, speaking truth to power, speaking truth, telling it like it is, etc. etc.
However at times it is so blunt and sometimes cold in its truth, that I can see how this book might be painful to some people.
I don't know why but I think it's because growing up in the particular rural area that I did, in the particular geography and time period and culture that I did, I was exposed, even if unknowingly and/or naturally and/or subconsciously, to many of these ideas when I grew up as a boy of ages about 3-20, including in elementary school and middle school and high school, and other areas of my life, family, friends, relationships, experience, and cultural exposure, when growing up in my formative years.
And so, it turns out, for me personally, when the author Tomassi tells different stories, defines terms, and talks ideas and examlples, I am being brought back decades in my own history  in my own mind and heart and soul and experience as I read these, and I am feeling that in hindsight I did touch many of these paradigms before.
And not only that, though, I also see other ideas he is presenting where I still have avoided them or seen but not engaged with tnem. 
So I think I can learn other new things, either what not to do, or what to do better, by reading this.
But man, by the way, I need to take frequent breaks when reading this book myself personally too. As this is really deep, raw, stuff, and so I'm not taking it lightly, and I feel I shouldn't be taking it lightly. Which takes some effort and meditating and time and digestion of the ideas.

If the above interests you, then maybe this book is for you too. 
If the above doesn't interest you, then maybe this book isn't for you or maybe think about it and consider it again later.

2024-06-04 “Ye Olden Pirate Budget” is Born.txt

i just dreamt this.

I hereby Invent what I am calling “Ye Olden Pirate Budget”.

It henceforth is born, and it is like this:

One document that describes incomes and expenses for three years out.

In a word, it could be called a budget.

However in my dream it is more than that.

In my dream it is the FEELING that is special when I make and use and feel this my special budget.

I feel like calling it "Ye Olden Pirate Budget" or something.

Because envisioned I write down ahead of time, 3 years out, where every penny will come from and where every penny will go to.

And at the same time, 3 years out, I make this plan.

And, the way in which I make this plan is such that there is more than enough money to cover a full thriving abundant experience-rich life.

And so then this makes me feel good.

I feel good to make a plan, including money sources and money destinations, that accounts for a fullfilling life.

And so let me go write this document right away.

And then let me live it.

If needed I'll edit the document.

And then I'll live it.

Then I'll keep editing and living according to this my 'Ye Olden Pirate Budget'.

And all the while I'll be living a life that is constantly full, thriving, abundant, experience-rich, and fulfilling.

And I'll have more than enough money while I'm doing this throughout.


Prediction 1:
One thing I predict this will mean is it will need to be a realistic budget and also I'll need to have self-discipline to stick to the budget or else realistically adjust it. Then again stick to it or again realistically re-adjust it.

Prediction 2:
A second thing I predict this will mean will be that I'll need to make effort to maintain good relationships and good boundaries with friends and family in my life, especially where money is involved, especially in order to stick to this my 'Ye Olden Pirate Budget'. Because my budget affects my friends and their budgets affect me. I will need to either stick to my budget when in comes to my friends, or else realistically re-adjust my budget when it comes to my friends, ongoing.

Fin.

Mysterious Seat At The Table

"the mysterious comings and goings of an offer of a seat at the table"

Is a phrase I use to describe this.

Here in this podcast episode they are also talking about this:

"... patriarchy ... seat at the table..."

Oh, Dang. My Coffee Cup Is On The Floor.

This is awkward:

So crude.
Would be much better if it had a coaster underneath it. ...
