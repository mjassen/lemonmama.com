<h2>#0010 - lemonmama Hardware show #001 Shop Vacuum Filter</h2>

Without any further introduction, here is one way how to change a filter on a shop vacuum:

1.) take the top off the shop vacuum.

2.) the top comes off and the filter is bolted on to the top from the underneath.

3.) note: at the bottom of the filter there is a bolt that holds bottom plate up, that in turn holds the filter up onto the top of the shop vacuum.

4.) get a replacement filter. The filter will look like a hollow canister. The sides of the filter, is a ring of thick papery material all around but the top and bottom are hollow/ring. So the shop vacuum filter is like a very tall donut that has the same shape as a can, but with no top or bottom. 

5.) After taking off the bottom bolt and the bottom plate, that both hold the filter snug up against the bottom inside of the shop vacuum top, then you take off the old filter.

6.) then put on the new filter. If you look at the top of the shop vacuum, now the old filter was removed down off the inside of the top of the shop vacuum, now there is a core exposed, the core hangs down from the inside top of the shop vacuum. Now I can lift the new shop vacuum filter up, moving it up around the core. So now as I hold the filter in place it is ready to bolt the new filter in place. Now I replace the  so it is surrounding the core For th 

7.) the final part of putting on the new filter is, to place the bottom plate up against the bottom of the filter, and finally to screw the nut up onto the shaft of the core. as the nut tightens onto the shaft of the core, it snugs the bottom plate upwards so it secures the shop vacuum filter into place up against the shop-vacuum-top.

8.) finally, now snap the top of the shop vacuum back down onto the body of the shop vacuum.

Done! shop vacuum filter has been replaced.
