<h2>#0015 - Trying to get 5 Friends</h2>

I'm trying to get 5 friends.

Recently I started trying to initiate hangouts with some people.

Also for about 1-3 years now, i started to keep an actual written list of names.
Of people who I'm trying to actively build a better relationship with the people on this list.

I never did this before recent years.

Some people will say this is manipulative.

However.

1.) Reading books like 'Never Eat Alone' by Keith Ferrazzi.

2.) And on Journey To Launch podcast in the past few years, there was a persona Isa Watson who had this idea folks should have a 'squad' of their ~12 closest people.

3.) And on Rich Dad Radio podcast in the past few years, host persona Robert Kiyosaki said something like, that it turns out he prefers to do business with the same handful of partners (maybe 5-6 partners more or less) over and over again, because since they work well together and succeed in business together, thus they like to continue to work again more together as the years go by.

Don't get me wrong, I also want to meet new people and also I know friends will still come and go in and out of my life ongoing. I do update my 'written list of names' regularly.

However it is very interesting to review the list of names weekly or monthly and ponder how each of the people written there are either growing closer or further with (from) me as time passes. 
And to consider which of those people who I would more like to cultivate closer relationship or which whom it's less important to me to cultivate a closer relationship.

In conclusion, I'm trying to get 5 friends.
