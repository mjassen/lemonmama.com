0022 Self Paced Video Courses






Ride or die training together beats training alone.

Companies have online training for employees.

These are self-paced video courses.
Some of the content is good and we can indeed learn relevant stuff quickly.

However I've never seen option to watch together with a friend at the same time and you both get credit.
This is messed up.
This is us humans Doing It Wrong™
This is a BS paradigm, it's only like 5% as effective as it could be if teamwork was rewarded.

!!! NOTE: SKIP TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS BLOG POST TO SEE SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS !!!

However the way it's currently done, workers are encouraged to sit by themself alone in a room with headphones watching videos/text/quizzes.
No option to sit and watch with some colleagues in-person together as a pair or a small group.

If you watch by yourself, you get rewarded with credit.
If you watch with a friend together and make a social time bonding learning, then one of you gets no credit.

Moments like this, I am grateful able to see right through BS paradigms like this.

In fact, how I noticed this paradigm, is that when I consider how to carve out time in my schedule.
To watch an online course.
I can feel in my gut a feeling that says, no, and says the reason is I don't want to waste any more 8-hour-long chunks of my life alone in front of a computer screen.
However If I spent 8 hours with a colleague bonding and learning and watching the videos and listening and talking together, that would be a different story, my gut says YAHS lets do that!
That would be uplifting, that is synergy.

So what's a solution to fix this broken paradigm?

HERE PROPOSED THREE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS, A, B, or C here below, to make it better and more social, when watching a self-paced video course:

Solution A.) 
Ask my boss if I can watch together with my friend and my boss overrides and approves giving us both credit.
That could work.
However which boss would be able, or have access, to grant this? 

Solution B.) 
Simply ask my colleague if they want to watch the training video once together, regardless of if who gets any credit.

Solution C.)
Ask my colleague if they want to watch the same training video together twice, once while logged in to their account and once while logged in to my account.
Having 2x social learning training sessions with an excellent colleague, is better than having 1x such session.

In conclusion, ride or die to watching training videos with a friend instead of alone.
