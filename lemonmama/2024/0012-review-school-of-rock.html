<h2>#0012 - Review: School of Rock (movie)</h2>

A review of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/School-of-Rock-DVD-Paramount-Comedy/153578470#lemonmama.com">School of Rock</a> movie  

1.)
I describe School of Rock movie as follows: 
Jack Black as Dewey Finn loves to rock but he is becoming a loser until he teaches some kids how to rock 'n roll and do Battle of the Bands.

2.)
About School of Rock movie I feel conflicted because Dewey Finn is a loser but then he persists and BS'es and wins people over and but first fails because folks including parents saw he broke the rules, and then succeeds because they finally saw what Finn and the kids were doing really showed heart. Also it was really entertaining the 'stick it to the man' theme because throughout the movie it was repeated that the point of rock' n roll is to stick it to The Man.

3.)
About School of Rock movie I think in the end, Dewey Finn isn't a loser.
