#0026 Odd Jobs Business Idea






#0026 Odd jobs personal assistant odd jobs business idea.

the idea is 

- part personal assistant 

- part "handyman service" (Handy person, its home repair, odd jobbs etc.)

- part "maid service" (House cleaner person, it's cleaning, tidying, etc.)

- part taskrabbit service. (i.e. project based odd jobs)

- part toastmasters (meet up and each person contributes, each speaks on (does) what they are good/knowledgeable about)

- part hardware store. (after all folks who do odd jobs and DIY come to hardware store)

- part tech support service (after all often what needs doing odd jobs is like customer service tech support)

- part chef service and dishwashing service (odd jobs)

- part employee-owned company

- part 1090-contractor -driven business (like amazon/UPS delivery contractors; running their own business delivering packages)

- delivering packages service

- part taxi service

- part bookkeeping service / tax prep assistance service

- part hotel concierge bellhop service. 

- part wordcamp / forum (workers could give lightning talks on topics when waiting for a job) (idealistic i know, hmmm...)

- part manpower/ part employment agency. (like where workers show up in the morning and may or may not get a gig for the day)

- part craigslist

- part landscaping service (after all jack-of-all-trades service workers are constantly growing their jobs (bee removal, sidewalk shoveling, sweeping snow off roof service, pest control, emptying junk bins from public areas, etc. etc.)

- part marketing agency blogging service 




note: 
people are key.
in fact it's the real business here.
it's part matchmaking service.
matching a worker with someone who needs work done.

and so it is project based.
it matters a lot less, maybe only 50%, what the project is (as long as it gets done) and matters a lot more, maybe 50% more-or-less, who are the customer+worker combo. 
because they need to get along and communicate.

we'd need constant training and re-training and constant guidelines setting and scope setting.
because this could obviously get out of hand.
like you think of if it were the wrong person (customer or worker) then they could start asking them, or offering them, to do all sorts of stuff including unethical an/or illegal stuff.

and so also we'd probably need the following pretty darn early on:
insurance / attorney / lawyer

so that's it.

In conclusion, these were ideas for odd jobs personal assistant business.
