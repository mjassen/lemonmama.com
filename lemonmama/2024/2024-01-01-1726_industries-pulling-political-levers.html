<h2>Top Industries Pulling Political Levers In Recent Decades</h2>
Big Banking - Wall Street (note this is huge, and crosses over all the others via huge corporations and huge banks)
Big Government - U.S.A. Federal Government agencies
Big Defense Contractors - a.k.a. Military Industrial Complex 
Big Pharma
Big Healthcare
Big Education
Big Oil - Energy
Big Media - Entertainment    
Big Crime - Mob Mafia Cartels (note: might cross over with big banking, depending)

Note. this condensed curated list is mine however lots of this note was inspired and spurred on when I listend to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3TIRqNcT1HHEh534zllHiu">JOE ROGAN PODCAST ep. #2016 - Patrick Bet-David</a>

Note: also (re) consider paradigm of a wise person once said what motivates people is (Status, Access, Power, Stuff) (power/control). So the people at the top of these "Big" organizations they may be at the point of their lives they want to be a god or the most powerful person in the world, etc etc.

Now some scenarios combinations, which COMBINED LEVERS are being pulled for each of the following 'political hot topics'. Also, note that "big banking" is involved in all of these. These:

covid pandemic  =  (big pharma) + (big banking) + (big government) + (big media) + (big healthcare)
ukraine war  =  (big defense) + (big banking) + (big oil) + (big media) + (big government)
gender identiy trans rights = (big pharma) + (big banking) + (big media) + (big government) + (big healthcare)
abortion rights = (big healthcare) + (big banking) + (big pharma)
global warming = (big oil) + (big banking) + (big government) + (big media) + (big defense)
war on terrorism = (big defense) + (big banking) + (big oil)
central bank digital currency = (big banking) + (big government) 
illegal drugs fentanyl opioids crisis = (big government) + (big media) + (big banking)
tate brothers mysogynist human trafficking accusations = (big media) + (big government) + (big banking)

In conclusion it does feel like these are top industries pulling political industries in recent decades.
