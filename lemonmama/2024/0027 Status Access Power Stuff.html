#0027 Status Access Power Stuff






A wise person once said, humans are motivated by the the following things:
status, access, power, stuff.

In that order, iirc.

<a href="https://sheeri.com/files/presentations/2012_manage.pdf">The Art of Cat Herding: How to Manage Geeks</a> from sheeri.com

And this has stuck with me for a decade on and off.

And so but these are abstract terms and so i want to look them up in the dictionary now:

<a href="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=status">stat·us (stătəs, stātəs)</a> ... 2. High standing; prestige: a position of status in the community.

<a href="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=access">ac·cess (ăksĕs)</a> ... 2. The ability or right to approach, enter, exit, communicate with, or make use of: has access to the restricted area; has access to classified material.

<a href="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=power">pow·er (pouər)</a> ... 3. a. The ability or official capacity to exercise control; authority: How long has that party been in power?

<a href="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=stuff">stuff (stŭf)</a> ... 9. Slang Money; cash.

In conclusion, humans are motivated by status, access, power, and stuff, in that order, as defined above.
