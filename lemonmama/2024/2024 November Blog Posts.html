<h3>Finish Setting Up， Not Your iPhone</h3>

My phone doesn’t tell me who’s phone it is.

I OBJECT!! It’s not MY iPhone. 

It’s just an iPhone.

The Director of development at Apple Inc has an interest to leverage control over my iPhone.
The Director of Development at Apple Inc also purposely pushes this clause “Your iPhone” Your iPhone..., Your iPhone..., Your iPhone... 
Push that verbiage onto any user of every iPhone.

And thus they subliminally hint it is yours.
And they control it.
It’s yours, but they control it.
It’s yours.
Things that you own, you control.
But they control it.
You own it but they control it.

Sigh.
In the end what It means to me is that I don’t own it.

TIL.
Today I Learned.

All iPhones and iPads are leased.
I get to use them but not own nor control them.

Know this.

Because this is also true of Microsoft devices and Samsung devices and Google devices and Apple devices.

These devices are all owned and controlled by the manufacturer.
I only get to use them.

This is a fact that I just learned today.

Even though it took me years to fully learn this.

And so this is why it’s important to reset one’s device to factory default not only monthly, but also randomly sporadically too multiple times per month on top of that.
In fact recently in May 2024 I witnessed that iPhone presses and offers to import full image /data/settings upon initial startup following a complete wipe.
Nope. The point of a a wipe, for me, is to regain some control.
Pretty soon multiple times per month complete wipe won’t be enough. 
One complete wipe per day will be needed.
Then soon after that one complete wipe after each usage of an app. So multiple wipes per day.


And so this is also why it’s important to get a dumbphone like a flip phone.

This is also why it’s important to have multiple devices, and just use one app per device.

“...Sign in to your iPhone.”

“Finish Setting Up Your iPhone...”

<h3>Weird Learning Failing Past Frustration</h3>

It's a weird feeling.

Learning you are failing at something.

But the weirder part is learning at the exact same time.

That you've been failing at that same thing for about 20 years.

And it's frustrating at first.

But it gets real weird when you get past the frustration.

And realize.

Now I am aware of my failure.

This time I failed and I know it.

Whereas I before every week for 20 years, I had been failing at the same thing and didn't know it.

So now I have the power to not fail at that anymore.

Feels good.

Once you get past that frustration.

Now I can recognize that failure as a pattern.

Now I can start to succeed at this.

UFC Paradigm Shift Especially With Mcgregor Vs. Diaz Notes

watched more fights. 3rd month-long subscription ended of espn+.

one thing i learned especially after the very last one where i watched video of Conor McGregor fighting Nate Diaz, these are characters.

And in this fight they were fighting to win this fight, not just to last 5 rounds. Each wanted to choke/knock the other out.
Also I had previously seen video of EACH of these fighter and so i remembered examples of how tough and gritty and smart each was.

Each one at this point was a champion and elite and amazing. 
And so in the end a champion elite amazing fighter would lose this fight.

More notes: each/both was really on their game in this fight it seemed. Quick, hungry, trained up endurance seemed.

And these characters it seems were both mentally ruthless and taunting.

One thing it seemed to me that, instead of being insulted or offended by McGregor's taunts, Diaz it seemed to me actually fed off of them. Which to me seemed unique becuase in my experience McGregor had usually been able to get under most other opponents' skin with his words, but in this case it seemed not so.

But interesting was watching McGregor getting beaten so badly. I thought he mentally and physically didn't care that he was getting beaten nor wobbly. It seemed to me that even bruised and wobbly he only stayed focused on how he might still win this fight. And then down on the ground he, and they both, scrambled with extreme quickness. 

And so it seems the fight came down to, among other things like skill training etc, fight came down to luck in some ways. 

But interesting after the fight McGregor seemed humble. Not embarrassed, not upset, just humble. As if he was literally learning from this experience how to do better his next time, right before our eyes.




watched about 8x fight night videos this time through. iirc:

UFC 196      (Mar 2016)        'UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz'                 fin.
UFC 195      (JAN 2016)        'UFC 195: Lawler vs. Condit'                fin.
UFC 194      (DEC 2015)        "UFC 194: Aldo vs. McGregor"                fin.
UFC 193      (NOV 2015)        "UFC 193: Rousey vs. Holm"                  fin.
UFC 192      (OCT 2015)        "UFC 192: Cormier vs. Gustafsson"           fin.
UFC 191      (SEP 2015)        "UFC 191: Johnson vs. Dodson 2"             fin.
UFC 190      (AUG 2015)        "Rousey Vs. Correia"                        fin.
UFC 189      (JUL 2015)        "UFC 189: Mendes vs. McGregor"


-
side note totally unrelated:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nate_Diaz&oldid=1220880090
IN ^this wikipedia article it said in passing Diaz at one point signed an 8 fight contract with the UFC.
Mo note: wow. so fighers may sign a multiple-fight-long contract with UFC / Dana White?
Good to know.
So because this is more the business side but also more the dedication/motivational/loyalty side too. 
So this could affect fighters in a good way, or in a bad way. Because maybe they are doing well to aspire to get a contract and finish the contract and win another contract etc. 
But on the other hand could affect in a bad way, what if they don't want to fight but feel compelled to do so just because of the contract.
