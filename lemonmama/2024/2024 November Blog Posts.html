<h3>Weird Learning Failing Past Frustration</h3>

It's a weird feeling.

Learning you are failing at something.

But the weirder part is learning at the exact same time.

That you've been failing at that same thing for about 20 years.

And it's frustrating at first.

But it gets real weird when you get past the frustration.

And realize.

Now I am aware of my failure.

This time I failed and I know it.

Whereas I before every week for 20 years, I had been failing at the same thing and didn't know it.

So now I have the power to not fail at that anymore.

Feels good.

Once you get past that frustration.

Now I can recognize that failure as a pattern.

Now I can start to succeed at this.

UFC Paradigm Shift Especially With Mcgregor Vs. Diaz Notes

watched more fights. 3rd month-long subscription ended of espn+.

one thing i learned especially after the very last one where i watched video of Conor McGregor fighting Nate Diaz, these are characters.

And in this fight they were fighting to win this fight, not just to last 5 rounds. Each wanted to choke/knock the other out.
Also I had previously seen video of EACH of these fighter and so i remembered examples of how tough and gritty and smart each was.

Each one at this point was a champion and elite and amazing. 
And so in the end a champion elite amazing fighter would lose this fight.

More notes: each/both was really on their game in this fight it seemed. Quick, hungry, trained up endurance seemed.

And these characters it seems were both mentally ruthless and taunting.

One thing it seemed to me that, instead of being insulted or offended by McGregor's taunts, Diaz it seemed to me actually fed off of them. Which to me seemed unique becuase in my experience McGregor had usually been able to get under most other opponents' skin with his words, but in this case it seemed not so.

But interesting was watching McGregor getting beaten so badly. I thought he mentally and physically didn't care that he was getting beaten nor wobbly. It seemed to me that even bruised and wobbly he only stayed focused on how he might still win this fight. And then down on the ground he, and they both, scrambled with extreme quickness. 

And so it seems the fight came down to, among other things like skill training etc, fight came down to luck in some ways. 

But interesting after the fight McGregor seemed humble. Not embarrassed, not upset, just humble. As if he was literally learning from this experience how to do better his next time, right before our eyes.




watched about 8x fight night videos this time through. iirc:

UFC 196      (Mar 2016)        'UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz'                 fin.
UFC 195      (JAN 2016)        'UFC 195: Lawler vs. Condit'                fin.

side note totally unrelated:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nate_Diaz&oldid=1220880090
IN ^this wikipedia article it said in passing Diaz at one point signed an 8 fight contract with the UFC.
Mo note: wow. so fighers may sign a multiple-fight-long contract with UFC / Dana White?
Good to know.
So because this is more the business side but also more the dedication/motivational/loyalty side too. 
So this could affect fighters in a good way, or in a bad way. Because maybe they are doing well to aspire to get a contract and finish the contract and win another contract etc. 
But on the other hand could affect in a bad way, what if they don't want to fight but feel compelled to do so just because of the contract.
