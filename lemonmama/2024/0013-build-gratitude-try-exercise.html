#0013 - To Build Gratitude And Build Consideration Try This Exercise



To build gratitude and build consideration, try this exercise.

For a person I know, answer the following questions:

What did this person talk about the last time we talked?
How was this person feeling the last time we talked?
What is this person working on?
What does this person want?
What does this person need?
How may I help this person?

Just the act of thinking about someone using these type of questions, should start to strengthen one's consideration level and start to strengthen one's gratitude level.
