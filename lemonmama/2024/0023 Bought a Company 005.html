0023 Bought a Company 005






0023 - I Bought a Company (day -194) [or I Bought a Company show #005] 我買了一個公司(從今天起194天)

I want to buy ¤5 of a company each day.

To get healthier, wealthier, and wiser.

Build discipline and make my life better.

In my opinion, it is better to each day first buy a part of a company, before buying, or instead of buying, any other extra stuff such as ¤5 cups of coffee or ¤5 containers of wine or ¤5 scratch tickets.

And so, here are the newest updates:

• Today I sent ¤5 for deposit to my brokerage for my brokerage account:

• Yesterday I also sent ¤5 for deposit to my brokerage for my brokerage account.

• Day before yesterday also ¤5:

• And three days ago I also mailed ¤5:

Further, I checked my brokerage online portal dashboard to see if any of my checks got there yet, and to see if the funds are available yet or not to see if I can start buying parts of a company yet or not.

I found that no, no funds are yet available.

But this makes sense. As I only started sending checks 7 days ago, and it takes a week for the check to get there, and then it takes 10 days after that for the check funds to become available. fine.

Here is screenshot of my transfer history on online brokerage account portal:

Here is a screenshot of my positions (that is the stocks/companies that I bought so far). Of course it is empty right now. Here:

Finally, today when mailing the letter I did see three separate snapping turtles laying eggs. They are going nuts about laying eggs today. This is a picture of one of them:

In conclusion, I did continue prepping to buy part of a company each day ongoing, towards trying to make my life healthier, wealthier, and wiser.
