<h2>Folks Only Need to Post Once on One Social Media Site not Duplicate Content on Multiple Channels</h2>

Only one channel is needed for posting and writing on social media.

Humans actively seek out the people and tribes that they want.
People actually mostly go and read what they want to read.
And these are the people you want reading your content anyway.
These are the people who are trying to seek it out.

Some organizations post to multiple channels to try and reach more people.
Some social media posters think their audience is only browsing one channel and not others.
But that is largely a fallacy.
A fallacy of social media in general is that people read what is put in front of them.

Instead, we only needs to post once on one social media channel.
And the interested readers will find us.
And this makes it easier for those readers to find, too.
Because if I browse to a group's home page, and see 6 social media icons.
Then I don't know which are the main channel that is updated most frequently with quality content. 
And so now as the reader I have to do more work to sort through those.

But if I browse to a group's home page and see one or two social media icons.
Say one to a public text/picture messaging app.
And the other to a longform video content app.
Then, I will easily know where to look for updates from that company. 

Of course I can read and view others' posts on others' channels.
But as for my own posting, it is common sense to just have one main good outlet.

This is for sites where they fill basically the same functionality.
For example text, pictures, short video clips.
All of the above sites have all of the below features:
LinkedIn, Twitter/X.com, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Threads, Youtube.
But I still see organizations where the organization has 4, 5, 6, or 7 different social media accounts and they post the __same__ messages on __all__ of them.
It just doesn't make sense to post duplicate content on multiple channels.

In summary, folks, and companies, you only need one good social media channel and just post all your content there. 
We'll find you! 
And it'll be easier for us to find you.

<h2>#0070 - The Goal is to Learn Jiu-Jitsu by Watching Videos</h2>

watch some jiu jitsu videos from ibjjf.com official youtube channel

These ones from this youtube channel: "IBJJF (International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation)" https://www.youtube.com/@ibjjf

Alexandre Seixas vs Leonardo Martins / Contagem Open 2024
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le9NwETL350


Gabriel Avila vs Lucas Amorim / Contagem Open 2024
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of7g9EcoJCo

Mateus Porto vs Oziel Santos / Contagem Open 2024
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LMQL5D85vw

next i saw the first was heavy doods. slower stronger action

the second was middle guys. faster. my weight but a few pounds heavier.

third was light feather. so some many pounds lighter than me.

and i saw the styles were different.

and so also i had  a hard time getting the personalities and the styles in just three short fights with 6 different fighters.

so next i get this idea.
i should may try to pick one fighter, maye in my weight class, and then just try to watch three videos of that one fighter fighting different opponents.
because then my idea is i will have a baseline.
my baseline will be that one fighter and their style.
and so i'll have a stable reference point 
from that stable reference point i think it'll be better easier faster more stable from which to grow from there.

so i search:

Gabriel Avila jiu jitsu
Lucas Amorim jiu jitsu

continue learning via jiujitsu videos

ok and so this search term on bing seems to get two or three different fights i think. so i think I'll try this next. this:
"Gabriel Avila" ibjjf

ok queue those search results up videos here for watch next time:

Luiz Paulo vs Gabriel Avila / São Paulo BJJ Pro 2023
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTYHtgIL6Qo
^ok so in this one Luiz Paulo wins by dicision. they are tumbling a lot and wrestling a lot, i'm not sure much of the time what is going on other than they are each trying to gain some sort of advantage and control the fight.

Gabriel Avila vs Luiz Paulo / Betim Open 2023
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2CODn65ZyQ
^this one indeed is a different fight even though it is the same two dudes.
in this fight Gabriel Avila wins by decision. They are tumbling around a lot. kinda similar to the other fight with these two i'd say. unfortunately i don't know either of them are really trying to do other than gain a better position and avoid being submitted. so they are both struggling the whole time as far as i can see.

this one is long so not sure how/if to find 'gabriel avila' therein even though it came up in the search results. here:
IBJJF Worlds 2023 | Black Belt Absolute Opening Rounds to Semifinals - Watch Live on FloGrappling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR9eVHcGA_g
^note this one i don't really watch at this point. because is longer i wanted to just try to focus / follow one fighter for now.

Mica Galvao vs Gabriel Avila / Brasileiro 2024
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je1upuuU74c
^wow in this one Mica Galvao fairly quickly ends up choking Gabriela Avila and Avila taps/submits due to that. 
And I watched it a second time because it was so fast.
And then I think i see that Mica Galvao was extremely persistent as they both tumbled around across the first 90 seconds, Mica Galvao was not letting go of his goal which evidently was to grab onto the legs/ back legs / back of Avila. And then steadily Galvao improved his grip up Avila's legs/back/shoulders and then fairly quickly establisted a choke hold from the back around Avila's throat+armpit, and then Avila tapped under the choke pressure danger.

and finally here again (from the first draft post linked above) is the first video where I had seen "Gabriel Avila" fighting ever. So i can re-watch it again to compare again:
Gabriel Avila vs Lucas Amorim / Contagem Open 2024
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of7g9EcoJCo
^ok in this one they are grappling and tumbling some a lot.
and i noticed Avila tries to choke Amorim from the back. but amorim slips his head oout of the elbow choke eventually.
At one time one tries to grab and lever the other's arm, looked like arm bar attempt.
looks like a lot of offensive and defensive maneuvering from both men throughout, and so, neither able to submit the other.
In the end Gabriel Avila wins by decision.

Mo additional notes on all the fights what things I learned:
they are grappling for position and but they are also trying to get arm bars and they are also trying to choke from the back.
and One thing i noticed, even if clothes/belts get loose and fall off, the ref never stops the fight.
With one exception one guys pants fell half off then the ref stopped the fight at an opportune pausing time.

And so i learned:
- i should try to choke and trty to arm bar. (once i learn how) (or immediately and that's how I'll learn how).
- I should keep fighting even if my belt and shirt and pants are loose. keep fighting unless the ref stops the fight. heck fight naked if i need to i guess.
- i should't lose position by re-centering to my fight to the center of the mat. if convenienet for me i can re-center the fight. or elase if convenient for me i can fight across the edge of the mat. whatever is best for me and doesn't hurt my position.
-I should try like a cockroach to grab and inch and crawl up the other guy's back and then try to choke them from behind. persistence.
- If a guy tries to choke me I can grab his arm and sleeve and I can slip my head out of his elbow. Get out of the choke quick as possible with all my strength.
- I think quick ezplosive actions can catch my opponent off guard. so choose a line/path towards their neck or arm, then commint to it, then move quick and iterate move quick iterate, move quick iterate as long as I am makeing progress. and don't stop unless it came to a stalemate. make a new plan and quick iterate on the new plan.

- in short. I must use my brain to tell all my body including legs and arms, to push pull jump anything, anything goes, to act as one force to choke them and get their back.
Or else use my whole self to tell my whole body to push pull slide lever my body and their body, to get their arm barred, like a monkey or a bear would do, no fear no hesitation, so quick don't even think. just adjust and iterate quick, adjust and iterate instant don't think. I don't even need to think of what 'move' to use. As long as my whole body including all four limbs and whole body, is all acting as one to choke them and grab their back, or arm bar them and lever their body and arm, then, all things go.
HOwever I should keep in mind i am not trying to permanently injure them nor myself. However beyond that I can do whatever is needed to quickly submit my opponent. This is my biggest takeaway here.

In conclusion, watching videos I learned about Jiu-Jitsu.

plot all of these against dollars.

<b>hint/clue. I averaged current prices against timeless Ye Olden Shells. And so the multiplier for 2024-12-30 thus is (₷¤1 Ye Olden Shell == $38.75)</b> So the multiplier for 2024-12-30 is thus ($1 == ₷¤0.0258 Ye Olden Shells).
	
next, I have to take dollars out of the equation. because this needs to be based on the ongoing unit not on the ongoing dollars.
ok so what i will do is plot these on multiple graphs and then choose which one(or average which one(s)) to represent that year's silver bams number/multiplier.
ok to do this. first i will graph all against dollars. and i will see which/where the lines converge. like i assume that most of these stats, vs dollars, most will have gone up and to the right in the past 10 years.
but that in my opinion really represents the dollar going down.
and so i will see which/how the different stats, go up and to the right, and take the average of those. and that will be Ye Olden Shells.
Ye Olden Shells represents a fictitious static monetary unit.

finally, i will say, as in past, that ₷¤365 Ye Olden Shells is represents average earthling yearly basic living expenses.
and that ₷¤730 Ye Olden Shells represents fairly abundant earthling income.

The goal of Ye Olden Shells remix.
BUT WHY?
Why have I been remixing Ye Olden Shells?
BUT WHY is the question !!??!!??

Answer can be here:

+ I want to find a measure of value that never changes through the decades.
+ and then I will call that Ye Olden Shells (₷¤)

wow.
when I put it that way.
Obviously it is gold/silver.
however. that does become more scarce it seems proportional to population.
still though it is good.
however there is another measure of value that stays the same.
that is 'a day's hard work'.
because throughout history.
it would have been commodity to work all day long.
and then it would have been commodity to pay someone for their work.
so a timeless unit of pay is, pay for 1 days work.
ok so a third timeless unit of value is, one day's meals.

so why don't i use these to peg 1 Ye Olden Shell? 
one of these:

• average Income  ** 1 year salary (/365)
• gold spot
• Japanese Yen
• Indian Rupee
• Euro
• ₿ Bitcoin 
• 1 bag lentils
• 1 box of girl scout cookies
• hot brewed starbucks coffee 12oz.       
• box wine 500ml                              
• bottle wine 750ml                              
• bottle wine 1.5L                               
• cooked BONE-IN HAM 4.45lbs              
• book of 20 stamps post office           
• one month mobile data phone service     
• a 25lb bag of rice at the store         
• Bottle London dry gin 750ml   
• 1 bottle rum (commodity/inexpensive)          
• automobile gas fillup 7.44 gallons
• American Silver Eagle $1 coin 1oz       
• eating out for 4 people on a budget     
• One weeks groceries at the store        
• three nights stay average hotel         
• American Gold Eagle coin 1 oz



In conclusion, this has been an update benchmarking Ye Olden Shells. Ye Olden Shells vs. dollars vs. various commodities.

<h2>#0067 - Adding Bookmark with Navigation to IPhone Home Screen</h2>

Problem: when adding bookmark to iphone home screen, for certain urls/sites, it adds it as a shortcut to a tab.

hack for adding a bookmark to iPhone Desktop.

an "Add to Home Screen" bookmark that is.

'Add to Home Screen' = '加入主畫面'

Workaround solution here. Steps a,b,c,d,e here:
a.  Turn off iPhone wifi/network 
b.  Type in to safari browser address bar, for example news.google.com or search.brave.com etc.
c.  Ofc browser shows like '...can't open the page...' No worries, proceed as usual to share button then choose "Add to Home Screen"
d.  See icon was added to iPhone home screen. Icon may say 'Can't Open Page' (you can rename that to whatever during creating it). In any case it still it created the bookmark, so job is done!
e.  Turn on wifi/network and test it. Now it launches safari in normal mode with navigation/back/forward buttons (doesn't launch in no-navigation app mode)

Screenshot below shows these three elements:
* bookmarks on the home page
* first bookmark opens in browser with navigation/tabs. this one was created while offline. nice.
* second bookmark opens in safari quasi-browser mode without navigation buttons.

Screenshot here:
<a href="uploads/2024-12-19-safari-browser-shortcut.jpg"><img src="uploads/2024-12-19-safari-browser-shortcut.jpg" width="200"></a> 

In conclusion, this has been about adding bookmark with navigation to iphone home screen.

<h2>#0066 - Bought A Company 012</h2>

• The goal is to get healthier, wealthier, and wiser.
• The project is that each day I buy ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells of a company.
• I opened a brokerage account.
• Each day for a month, I mailed a check for ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells to my brokerage.
• When the dust cleared at the end of the month, I had sent ₷¤115 Ye Olden Shells to my brokerage
• I used each of those ₷¤5 chunks to buy a company, one piece at a time.
• It's been 202 days since (2024-May-23rd)  since my post <a href="https://www.lemontofu.com/p/0004-i-bought-a-company-day-200">Bought a Company 002</a> 
• So when the dust cleared here was my starting point was, ₷¤15 Shells Cash and ₷¤10 Shells worth each of the following ten companies: FDX FIVE HSY KO MCD NKE PEP SBUX UPS WMT

Here’s today’s project update: 今天報告一下

1.)
Here is a screenshot of the positions, of the companies that I bought:

<a href="uploads/0064-positions-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0064-positions-01.jpg" width="200"></a> 


2.) 
So far half of the companies value increased, and the other half of the companies the value decreased. So five and five.

3.)
My biggest winners so far have been WMT and FIVE, whereas my biggest losers so far have been PEP and HSY. The other six companies were somewhere in between those.

4.)
So according to the screenshot of the brokerage portal, my total portfolio is currently worth ₷¤124.16 Ye Olden Shells. 
Therefore I say the value rose from ₷¤115 Shells to ₷¤124.16 Shells in the past 202 days. 
So that's good for me. 
However my own personal note on this further is I personally believe the stock market is also in a huge bubble in 2024. And I can't say that the value of cash isn't plummetting too, and also I can't say that we aren't headed for a gigantic economy crash (USA and even the world) in the coming years or months. So. I am still glad I bought these companies as I still prefer companies to cash. However. I am doing my own research and making my own decisions, and trying to learn and trying to become happier and more wealthy in 2024.
 

In conclusion, I bought companies, held companies, didn't sell any companies, learned a lot, and made my life healthier, wealthier, and wiser.

<h2>Dont Link Your Identity</h2>

Note to self: the title says YOU but the body intro sentence switches to using I. ON PURPOSE. Because the title SHOULD be patronizing and should grab people. However the explanation shouldn't be confrontational nor patronizing.



Title:
Don't Link Your Identity to Your Phone


Body:
I Don't Link My Identity To My Phone


Here are some ways how I do this:

* I got, and have, a job and a lifestyle, and a toastmasters club, where I talk with people face to face every day.

* Every 30 days without fail, I reset my smartphone to factory default settings.

* I got a second phone and use it for half/some of my digital activities. That way no single device seems to control my identity.

* As my main voice-call and SMS-text device, I use a dumbphone (flip phone).

* I switch back and forth between my dumb phone and smart phone as needed, but default to the dumb phone.

* I got and have a laptop computer and use that for some digital activities instead of my phone. (always email, sometimes podcasts)

* I backup all my data and contacts and photos to static physical devices (DVD or external hard drive or USB flash drive). I don't back any of my __important__ data (that I feel I can't go without) to the cloud.

* I keep my main master contact list (address book) in a computer file, not in my smartphone

* I try out other free non-commercial messaging/calling apps, for example like GNU Jami.






Here are some benefits to this:

* I control my phone, my phone doesn't control me.

* I reduce, or keep at bay, what I call "iPhone Mind Control". Note: Not just iPhone but facebook/instagram, google, snapchat, microsoft, tiktok, twitter/x.com, etc. etc. etc.

* I shake off the feeling that "I feel like I can't be without my smartphone for a day".

* I spend less time looking at a screen and that is better for my mind, beter for my eyes, better for my health.


In conclusion, don't link your identity. Save my data to devices and drives that I control. Use files and devices and apps that I control. Use multiple devices, and reset devices monthly/weekly to default blank state. Thus I control my identity on my devices.

<h2>Eleven Step Mega Update - Bought a Company 011</h2>

The project is that I will buy ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells of a company each day.

To get healthier, wealthier, and wiser.

Build discipline and make my life better.

In my opinion, it is better to each day first buy a part of a company, before buying, or instead of buying, any other extra stuff such as:
₷¤5 Shells of gazingus pins, or 
₷¤5 Shells of coffee, or 
₷¤5 Shells of wine, or
₷¤5 Shells of scratch tickets.

This project update is listed in 11 steps, here below.
 
Here’s today’s project update: 今天報告一下


1.)
It's been 196 days since my post <a href="https://www.lemontofu.com/p/0004-i-bought-a-company-day-200">Bought a Company 002</a> 

2.)
So far, ONE PER DAY, I sent a bunch more of ₷¤5 checks for deposit, to my brokerage for my brokerage account. Here are a few screenshots:
<a href="uploads/0063-check-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-04.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-04.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-05.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-05.jpg" width="50"></a>


3.)
Note that it takes a week for each check to get there, and then it takes 10 days after that for the check funds to become available.


4.) 
Here are a few screenshots, as the days went by, of my transfer history on online brokerage account portal:
<a href="uploads/0063-transfer-history-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-transfer-history-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-transfer-history-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-transfer-history-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-transfer-history-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-transfer-history-03.jpg" width="50"></a>


5.)
Around this time i noticed a 'balances' page on my brokerage portal, which showed the funds were on 'hold'. I understand this means the checks got there but didn't yet become available. Here are a few screenshots, including screenshots of ¤30 Shells on hold and then ¤65 Shells on hold:
<a href="uploads/0063-balances-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-balances-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-balances-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-balances-04.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-04.jpg" width="50"></a>


6.)
As the weeks went by, the funds started becoming available. And so I started buying companies. I bought them in ₷¤5 chunks, one per day. Here are screenshots of buying a few companies. Notice since i buy such small chunks, thus I can't buy one full share of a company each time. For example in one screenshot I spent ₷¤5 Shells and bought "0.0745 shares" of a company, and for another the same amount of money bought "0.0429 shares". Screenshots here:
<a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-04-filled.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-04-filled.jpg" width="50"></a>
 
 
7.)
As more days and weeks went by, here are a bunch of screenshots of the positions, of the companies that I bought. At first I had no positions. Then after I started buying companies, each company starts showing in the list along with the size of the position I hold in that company:
<a href="uploads/0063-positions-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-04.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-04.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-05.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-05.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-06.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-06.jpg" width="50"></a>


8.)
Here's my list of 10 companies (in alphabetical order) that I ended up buying for this project:
FDX  - FEDEX CORPORATION
FIVE - FIVE BELOW
HSY  - HERSHEY CO/THE
KO   - COCA-COLA CO/THE
MCD  - MC DONALD'S-CORP
NKE  - NIKE INC -CL B
PEP  - PEPSICO INC
SBUX - STARBUCKS CORP
UPS  - UNITED PARCEL SERVICE-CL B
WMT  - WALMART INC


9.)
I learned one thing that is it was exhausiting daily sending check and daily logging on daily checking account and daily buying one small position.
So I may switch to a fortnightly sending/buying ongoing instead of daily.


10.)
I learned a second thing, that is that buying companies, even using physical tokens like envelopes, stamps, checks, and bitsycards, didn't quite work as I expected it. In other words I see the allure of buying (coffee, beer, scratch tickets) is still very alluring, so the gamifying that I did of trying to buy a company each day, didn't totally replace those. So need to still pivot more. Maybe need to find another habit to replace those other bad habits. Actually since then started another habit, training daily Jiu-Jitsu gym, that is doing pretty good to replace any of my bad habits. 


11.)
I learned a third thing, and did something.
I really did, for about 30 days or so, prepped to buy, and bought, part of a company each day. And in the end I did end up with 10x different companies, ₷¤5 (x2) worth of each company. And as a result, I learned how to go through the motions of investing in companies, and it did make my life healthier, wealthier, and wiser.


In conclusion, I bought companies daily, became exhausted, learned a lot, and made my life healthier, wealthier, and wiser.

<h2>Updates on “Buy a Company Every Day Project” -- Bought a Company 010</h2>

About 14 days ago i went on hiatus.
Personal note is i went vacation.
But point is i stopped sending in checks for ₷¤5 Shells each day.

During that time i paused and kept one of the bitsycards in my wallet as it happened to be the one i paused on/after "day -178".

Ok now I am back from vacation.

I see that where i paused was also that i had bought (3) x (₷¤5) worth of stocks so far:

<a href="uploads/0062-positions-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0062-positions-01.jpg" width="200"></a>


so 
₷¤5 WMT
₷¤5 FIVE
₷¤5 HSY

cool.

And in the meantime, while on hiatus, the rest of my checks got deposited and ready to buy stock. So now ₷¤100 Shells ready to go!

and so now am back from hiatus.

So I go ahead and i keep/resume buying stocks ₷¤5 Shells per day.

so now I buy
₷¤5 NKE

However.

The update is that while on hiatus i realized how burned out i had been sending in a check every single morning.

So.

Now i think I learned my lesson.

I got discipline to send the money.

And so I propose i will now, for the rest of the 200 days, do the following, a more relaxed schedule but still fairly disciplined.

1. - send a check once per week instead of once per day.

2. - put roughly one market order per day the standard ₷¤5 of a company per day. BUT IF I MISS A DAY ILL JUST DO TWO THE NEXT DAY in order less strict and grueling.


These two changes will make it so that i'll still be dollar cost averaging, but, now on more of a daily weekly basis. instead of a daily basis.  weekly instead of daily.

In conclusion, i went on hiatus, then came back and was recharged, but at the same time realized I had been burned out. So I learned. So now I'm tweaking my strategry to be more sustainable. Onwards!

<h2>Day -184 -- Bought a Company 009</h2>

Notes from today and for the project:

Today is day "-184"

So I've been doing this for about 16 days or so, counting down from 200 towards 1.

It's grueling, I don't recommend doing this type of game.

Observations:

* It's still not as satisfying, not the same, short term, each day so far, compared to buying and enjoying a hot cup or coffee, or buying and enjoying a couple of cold beers.

* It seems more like work, some days I get distracted and it takes me an hour to:
- log on to the brokerage portal, and 
- write the check for ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells, and 
- address the envelope, and
- write the bitsycard, and
- go mail the letter

* 'funds on hold' is up to ₷¤65.00 Ye Olden Shells. No funds yet ready to buy stocks. Painful waiting.


However, the above tediousness I have made some progress that feels promising to me:

** I am awaiting the day should be soon, when the funds will go off of 'hold' and be ready to buy some companies. So looking forward to this, makes it a bit enjoyable.

** I started writing song names on the bitsycard each day. Totally unrelated to the goal here. However. What it does is makes it more fun. Make it a game. It's usually a song I heard on the radio or on the streaming, that morning when prepping the check/deposit/mailing. And its unique each day so adds color and motion and energy to the process in my opinion.

** I started carrying the bitsycard for that day, in my wallet each day. It somehow feels good to allways carry on me every minute this token of my project. And this token is fresh renewed each day. For example If I see folks around me buying gazingus pins like coffee or wine or scratch tickets during the day, and feel like buying a gazingus pin myself, then, what I can do is quick take out my fresh bitsycard from my wallet and hold it and look at it and maybe sing the song written thereupon, and maybe feel better that this is a placeholder for my gazingus pin and this placeholder in in my opinion represents a positive investment of money instead of a needless drain of money.


So all told, I may still need to tweak it more before it will be as satisfying as my old gazingus pins. However it already is getting more enjoyable. So we'll see.

So those are some updates.

In conclusion, investing ₷¤5 per day buying a company is still not the same thing as buying a gazingus pin, however, by making it a game, It is getting more and more enjoyable so I'll plan to keep with it for now.

<h2>Day -187 Rent’s Due -- Bought a Company 008</h2>

It's day -187, and the Rent's Due.

I need to pay the rent.

Every day.

Perform every day.

It's tedious.

So it's day -187.

So about 13 days now in a row.

I sent 13 checks in, each for ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells.

Four of them I made a mistake and so got delayed.

Looking now in the account, ₷¤30 Ye Olden Shells are on hold waiting to be processed.

As soon as those are processed I can use them to buy a company.

Also I started waffling on which companies to buy.

I chose 10 company names of brands I like.

There is a bit of a theme of pairs of companies in the same niche (Home Depot & Lowe's) and (PepsiCo & Coca-Cola) and (FedEx & UPS).

This is on purpose because I like to buy more than one company even if they are in the same niche. No one says I can't. I'm gonna.

Another thing I ran into in the past few days.

I really started embracing the bitsycard aspect in the last few days.

I love the feeling of holding that bitsycard on the way back from dropping the check in the mailbox.

I like to hold it like a receipt.

And I usually listen to music during this whole process at 5am.
And so I usually hear a song I like during this time.
And so I took to putting the name of a song I like, that I heard during these minutes/hour, on the bitsycard.

No reason, but makes it fun.

Make it a game.

And I write on the bitsycard which company earmarked to buy with that particular day's ₷¤5 deposit.

And I put the bitsycard for that day in my wallet.

So I can look at it anytime in the day and remind myself that rent's due.

In conclusion, Im still gonna buy a company every day. It's tedious but bitsycard makes it a game. Rent's due.

<h2>Make it a Game Try To Create Physical Systems and Tokens - Bought a Company 007</h2>

why make it a game?

why treat it like a game like this and test the systems here like this?
Should I double down? Easy up? Hold the course? Tweak it and continue?

An answer can be this:

I'm frustrated from seeing, and doing, systems in my world that make it easy to do the following things:
- make it easy for me to buy a gazingus pin* every day
- make it eazy for me to buy a ¤5 cup of coffee every day
- easy to buy ¤5 wine or beer every day
- make it easy to buy a ¤5 scratch ticket every day.

I want to find a way to replace that with a different habit, one that might feel the same but instead of my money 100% guaranteed gone afterwards, instead my money invested in a legitimate asset afterwards.
And so with a realistic chance on not losing 100% of my money, and at the same time a realistic, even modest, chance of returning money.

So now it is day 6 or so, and however i bumped into stuff that feels like i'm trying to put a square peg in a round hole.

I feel like i'm really taxing the following systems and maybe not in a good way:
- USPS mail delivery
- my local bank (checking account)
- my personal expenses (buying stamps and envelopes and checks (blank checks / personal checks / paper checks) 
- my brokerage (they have to process all these, assuming a person there sees all these come in they'll know I'm constructing doing some kind of game or test likely.
- the envonment using paper envelopes

A note on physical material tokens. I do pay for stamps /delivery, and for checks, and i follow the payment schemes of the bank and the brokerage. So I'm still following all rules. However I feel like I'm using these systems more than other people.

And but should I stop?
Should I double down?
Keep on the same?
Keep on but tweak it a little?

Hmm.
I think the answer for now is I should keep going as long as I am learning.
Keep on and tweak it a little for now.

Today I started drawing a little bitsycard 'receipt' for each ¤5 check that I sent out. To have a gazingus pin to hold in my hand representing each check sent out.
Today I also had to order checks. ¤38 for that. I had factored in cost of stamps and envelopes but not the cost of blank paper checks. But still I press on so far.

A second note on physical material tokens. Each day if I see a paper coffee cup, a beer can, or a paper scratch ticket, it reminds me that those systems also create waste and use material resources too. In fact those tokens I believe are part of what make those systems so popular and appealing. That's why my game in this stage is trying to copy those systems with creating and moving around physical tokens as well too.
I think for now my approach is, have faith that the systems will hold fast, and the tests will pass, and I'll be able to make this a game, at least for a while.

And then once I learned what I wnted to learn, and tested what I wanted to test, then, I could either keep going, or back off, at that point.
This seems like the right approach at this moment in this project.
So thanks to the folks behind the scenes helping with this project.

In conclusion, I'm gamifying the concept of I Bought A Company, making and using physical systems and tokens, it's a bit of a square peg in a round hole, but I'm actually performing the act of investing, so it is making me learn how to get wealthier, and also but I'm still learning so still pressing on for now.
