Day -187 Rent’s Due -- Bought a Company 008

It's day -187, and the Rent's Due.

I need to pay the rent.

Every day.

Perform every day.

It's tedious.

So it's day -187.

So about 13 days now in a row.

I sent 13 checks in, each for ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells.

Four of them I made a mistake and so got delayed.

Looking now in the account, ₷¤30 Ye Olden Shells are on hold waiting to be processed.

As soon as those are processed I can use them to buy a company.

Also I started waffling on which companies to buy.

I chose 10 company names of brands I like.

There is a bit of a theme of pairs of companies in the same niche (Home Depot & Lowe's) and (PepsiCo & Coca-Cola) and (FedEx & UPS).

This is on purpose because I like to buy more than one company even if they are in the same niche. No one says I can't. I'm gonna.

Another thing I ran into in the past few days.

I really started embracing the bitsycard aspect in the last few days.

I love the feeling of holding that bitsycard on the way back from dropping the check in the mailbox.

I like to hold it like a receipt.

And I usually listen to music during this whole process at 5am.
And so I usually hear a song I like during this time.
And so I took to putting the name of a song I like, that I heard during these minutes/hour, on the bitsycard.

No reason, but makes it fun.

Make it a game.

And I write on the bitsycard which company earmarked to buy with that particular day's ₷¤5 deposit.

And I put the bitsycard for that day in my wallet.

So I can look at it anytime in the day and remind myself that rent's due.

In conclusion, Im still gonna buy a company every day. It's tedious but bitsycard makes it a game. Rent's due.

<h2>Make it a Game Try To Create Physical Systems and Tokens - Bought a Company 007</h2>

why make it a game?

why treat it like a game like this and test the systems here like this?
Should I double down? Easy up? Hold the course? Tweak it and continue?

An answer can be this:

I'm frustrated from seeing, and doing, systems in my world that make it easy to do the following things:
- make it easy for me to buy a gazingus pin* every day
- make it eazy for me to buy a ¤5 cup of coffee every day
- easy to buy ¤5 wine or beer every day
- make it easy to buy a ¤5 scratch ticket every day.

I want to find a way to replace that with a different habit, one that might feel the same but instead of my money 100% guaranteed gone afterwards, instead my money invested in a legitimate asset afterwards.
And so with a realistic chance on not losing 100% of my money, and at the same time a realistic, even modest, chance of returning money.

So now it is day 6 or so, and however i bumped into stuff that feels like i'm trying to put a square peg in a round hole.

I feel like i'm really taxing the following systems and maybe not in a good way:
- USPS mail delivery
- my local bank (checking account)
- my personal expenses (buying stamps and envelopes and checks (blank checks / personal checks / paper checks) 
- my brokerage (they have to process all these, assuming a person there sees all these come in they'll know I'm constructing doing some kind of game or test likely.
- the envonment using paper envelopes

A note on physical material tokens. I do pay for stamps /delivery, and for checks, and i follow the payment schemes of the bank and the brokerage. So I'm still following all rules. However I feel like I'm using these systems more than other people.

And but should I stop?
Should I double down?
Keep on the same?
Keep on but tweak it a little?

Hmm.
I think the answer for now is I should keep going as long as I am learning.
Keep on and tweak it a little for now.

Today I started drawing a little bitsycard 'receipt' for each ¤5 check that I sent out. To have a gazingus pin to hold in my hand representing each check sent out.
Today I also had to order checks. ¤38 for that. I had factored in cost of stamps and envelopes but not the cost of blank paper checks. But still I press on so far.

A second note on physical material tokens. Each day if I see a paper coffee cup, a beer can, or a paper scratch ticket, it reminds me that those systems also create waste and use material resources too. In fact those tokens I believe are part of what make those systems so popular and appealing. That's why my game in this stage is trying to copy those systems with creating and moving around physical tokens as well too.
I think for now my approach is, have faith that the systems will hold fast, and the tests will pass, and I'll be able to make this a game, at least for a while.

And then once I learned what I wnted to learn, and tested what I wanted to test, then, I could either keep going, or back off, at that point.
This seems like the right approach at this moment in this project.
So thanks to the folks behind the scenes helping with this project.

In conclusion, I'm gamifying the concept of I Bought A Company, making and using physical systems and tokens, it's a bit of a square peg in a round hole, but I'm actually performing the act of investing, so it is making me learn how to get wealthier, and also but I'm still learning so still pressing on for now.
