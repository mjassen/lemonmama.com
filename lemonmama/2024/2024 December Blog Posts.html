<h2>Dont Link Your Identity</h2>

Note to self: the title says YOU but the body intro sentence switches to using I. ON PURPOSE. Because the title SHOULD be patronizing and should grab people. However the explanation shouldn't be confrontational nor patronizing.



Title:
Don't Link Your Identity to Your Phone


Body:
I Don't Link My Identity To My Phone


Here are some ways how I do this:

* I got, and have, a job and a lifestyle, and a toastmasters club, where I talk with people face to face every day.

* Every 30 days without fail, I reset my smartphone to factory default settings.

* I got a second phone and use it for half/some of my digital activities. That way no single device seems to control my identity.

* As my main voice-call and SMS-text device, I use a dumbphone (flip phone).

* I switch back and forth between my dumb phone and smart phone as needed, but default to the dumb phone.

* I got and have a laptop computer and use that for some digital activities instead of my phone. (always email, sometimes podcasts)

* I backup all my data and contacts and photos to static physical devices (DVD or external hard drive or USB flash drive). I don't back any of my __important__ data (that I feel I can't go without) to the cloud.

* I keep my main master contact list (address book) in a computer file, not in my smartphone

* I try out other free non-commercial messaging/calling apps, for example like GNU Jami.






Here are some benefits to this:

* I control my phone, my phone doesn't control me.

* I reduce, or keep at bay, what I call "iPhone Mind Control". Note: Not just iPhone but facebook/instagram, google, snapchat, microsoft, tiktok, twitter/x.com, etc. etc. etc.

* I shake off the feeling that "I feel like I can't be without my smartphone for a day".

* I spend less time looking at a screen and that is better for my mind, beter for my eyes, better for my health.


In conclusion, don't link your identity. Save my data to devices and drives that I control. Use files and devices and apps that I control. Use multiple devices, and reset devices monthly/weekly to default blank state. Thus I control my identity on my devices.

<h2>Eleven Step Mega Update - Bought a Company 011</h2>

The project is that I will buy ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells of a company each day.

To get healthier, wealthier, and wiser.

Build discipline and make my life better.

In my opinion, it is better to each day first buy a part of a company, before buying, or instead of buying, any other extra stuff such as:
₷¤5 Shells of gazingus pins, or 
₷¤5 Shells of coffee, or 
₷¤5 Shells of wine, or
₷¤5 Shells of scratch tickets.

This project update is listed in 11 steps, here below.
 
Here’s today’s project update: 今天報告一下


1.)
It's been 196 days since my post <a href="https://www.lemontofu.com/p/0004-i-bought-a-company-day-200">Bought a Company 002</a> 

2.)
So far, ONE PER DAY, I sent a bunch more of ₷¤5 checks for deposit, to my brokerage for my brokerage account. Here are a few screenshots:
<a href="uploads/0063-check-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-04.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-04.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-check-05.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-check-05.jpg" width="50"></a>


3.)
Note that it takes a week for each check to get there, and then it takes 10 days after that for the check funds to become available.


4.) 
Here are a few screenshots, as the days went by, of my transfer history on online brokerage account portal:
<a href="uploads/0063-transfer-history-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-transfer-history-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-transfer-history-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-transfer-history-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-transfer-history-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-transfer-history-03.jpg" width="50"></a>


5.)
Around this time i noticed a 'balances' page on my brokerage portal, which showed the funds were on 'hold'. I understand this means the checks got there but didn't yet become available. Here are a few screenshots, including screenshots of ¤30 Shells on hold and then ¤65 Shells on hold:
<a href="uploads/0063-balances-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-balances-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-balances-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-balances-04.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-balances-04.jpg" width="50"></a>


6.)
As the weeks went by, the funds started becoming available. And so I started buying companies. I bought them in ₷¤5 chunks, one per day. Here are screenshots of buying a few companies. Notice since i buy such small chunks, thus I can't buy one full share of a company each time. For example in one screenshot I spent ₷¤5 Shells and bought "0.0745 shares" of a company, and for another the same amount of money bought "0.0429 shares". Screenshots here:
<a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-buy-company-04-filled.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-buy-company-04-filled.jpg" width="50"></a>
 
 
7.)
As more days and weeks went by, here are a bunch of screenshots of the positions, of the companies that I bought. At first I had no positions. Then after I started buying companies, each company starts showing in the list along with the size of the position I hold in that company:
<a href="uploads/0063-positions-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-01.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-02.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-03.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-03.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-04.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-04.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-05.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-05.jpg" width="50"></a> <a href="uploads/0063-positions-06.jpg"><img src="uploads/0063-positions-06.jpg" width="50"></a>


8.)
Here's my list of 10 companies (in alphabetical order) that I ended up buying for this project:
FDX  - FEDEX CORPORATION
FIVE - FIVE BELOW
HSY  - HERSHEY CO/THE
KO   - COCA-COLA CO/THE
MCD  - MC DONALD'S-CORP
NKE  - NIKE INC -CL B
PEP  - PEPSICO INC
SBUX - STARBUCKS CORP
UPS  - UNITED PARCEL SERVICE-CL B
WMT  - WALMART INC


9.)
I learned one thing that is it was exhausiting daily sending check and daily logging on daily checking account and daily buying one small position.
So I may switch to a fortnightly sending/buying ongoing instead of daily.


10.)
I learned a second thing, that is that buying companies, even using physical tokens like envelopes, stamps, checks, and bitsycards, didn't quite work as I expected it. In other words I see the allure of buying (coffee, beer, scratch tickets) is still very alluring, so the gamifying that I did of trying to buy a company each day, didn't totally replace those. So need to still pivot more. Maybe need to find another habit to replace those other bad habits. Actually since then started another habit, training daily Jiu-Jitsu gym, that is doing pretty good to replace any of my bad habits. 


11.)
I learned a third thing, and did something.
I really did, for about 30 days or so, prepped to buy, and bought, part of a company each day. And in the end I did end up with 10x different companies, ₷¤5 (x2) worth of each company. And as a result, I learned how to go through the motions of investing in companies, and it did make my life healthier, wealthier, and wiser.


In conclusion, I bought companies daily, became exhausted, learned a lot, and made my life healthier, wealthier, and wiser.

<h2>Updates on “Buy a Company Every Day Project” -- Bought a Company 010</h2>

About 14 days ago i went on hiatus.
Personal note is i went vacation.
But point is i stopped sending in checks for ₷¤5 Shells each day.

During that time i paused and kept one of the bitsycards in my wallet as it happened to be the one i paused on/after "day -178".

Ok now I am back from vacation.

I see that where i paused was also that i had bought (3) x (₷¤5) worth of stocks so far:

<a href="uploads/0062-positions-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/0062-positions-01.jpg" width="200"></a>


so 
₷¤5 WMT
₷¤5 FIVE
₷¤5 HSY

cool.

And in the meantime, while on hiatus, the rest of my checks got deposited and ready to buy stock. So now ₷¤100 Shells ready to go!

and so now am back from hiatus.

So I go ahead and i keep/resume buying stocks ₷¤5 Shells per day.

so now I buy
₷¤5 NKE

However.

The update is that while on hiatus i realized how burned out i had been sending in a check every single morning.

So.

Now i think I learned my lesson.

I got discipline to send the money.

And so I propose i will now, for the rest of the 200 days, do the following, a more relaxed schedule but still fairly disciplined.

1. - send a check once per week instead of once per day.

2. - put roughly one market order per day the standard ₷¤5 of a company per day. BUT IF I MISS A DAY ILL JUST DO TWO THE NEXT DAY in order less strict and grueling.


These two changes will make it so that i'll still be dollar cost averaging, but, now on more of a daily weekly basis. instead of a daily basis.  weekly instead of daily.

In conclusion, i went on hiatus, then came back and was recharged, but at the same time realized I had been burned out. So I learned. So now I'm tweaking my strategry to be more sustainable. Onwards!

<h2>Day -184 -- Bought a Company 009</h2>

Notes from today and for the project:

Today is day "-184"

So I've been doing this for about 16 days or so, counting down from 200 towards 1.

It's grueling, I don't recommend doing this type of game.

Observations:

* It's still not as satisfying, not the same, short term, each day so far, compared to buying and enjoying a hot cup or coffee, or buying and enjoying a couple of cold beers.

* It seems more like work, some days I get distracted and it takes me an hour to:
- log on to the brokerage portal, and 
- write the check for ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells, and 
- address the envelope, and
- write the bitsycard, and
- go mail the letter

* 'funds on hold' is up to ₷¤65.00 Ye Olden Shells. No funds yet ready to buy stocks. Painful waiting.


However, the above tediousness I have made some progress that feels promising to me:

** I am awaiting the day should be soon, when the funds will go off of 'hold' and be ready to buy some companies. So looking forward to this, makes it a bit enjoyable.

** I started writing song names on the bitsycard each day. Totally unrelated to the goal here. However. What it does is makes it more fun. Make it a game. It's usually a song I heard on the radio or on the streaming, that morning when prepping the check/deposit/mailing. And its unique each day so adds color and motion and energy to the process in my opinion.

** I started carrying the bitsycard for that day, in my wallet each day. It somehow feels good to allways carry on me every minute this token of my project. And this token is fresh renewed each day. For example If I see folks around me buying gazingus pins like coffee or wine or scratch tickets during the day, and feel like buying a gazingus pin myself, then, what I can do is quick take out my fresh bitsycard from my wallet and hold it and look at it and maybe sing the song written thereupon, and maybe feel better that this is a placeholder for my gazingus pin and this placeholder in in my opinion represents a positive investment of money instead of a needless drain of money.


So all told, I may still need to tweak it more before it will be as satisfying as my old gazingus pins. However it already is getting more enjoyable. So we'll see.

So those are some updates.

In conclusion, investing ₷¤5 per day buying a company is still not the same thing as buying a gazingus pin, however, by making it a game, It is getting more and more enjoyable so I'll plan to keep with it for now.

<h2>Day -187 Rent’s Due -- Bought a Company 008</h2>

It's day -187, and the Rent's Due.

I need to pay the rent.

Every day.

Perform every day.

It's tedious.

So it's day -187.

So about 13 days now in a row.

I sent 13 checks in, each for ₷¤5 Ye Olden Shells.

Four of them I made a mistake and so got delayed.

Looking now in the account, ₷¤30 Ye Olden Shells are on hold waiting to be processed.

As soon as those are processed I can use them to buy a company.

Also I started waffling on which companies to buy.

I chose 10 company names of brands I like.

There is a bit of a theme of pairs of companies in the same niche (Home Depot & Lowe's) and (PepsiCo & Coca-Cola) and (FedEx & UPS).

This is on purpose because I like to buy more than one company even if they are in the same niche. No one says I can't. I'm gonna.

Another thing I ran into in the past few days.

I really started embracing the bitsycard aspect in the last few days.

I love the feeling of holding that bitsycard on the way back from dropping the check in the mailbox.

I like to hold it like a receipt.

And I usually listen to music during this whole process at 5am.
And so I usually hear a song I like during this time.
And so I took to putting the name of a song I like, that I heard during these minutes/hour, on the bitsycard.

No reason, but makes it fun.

Make it a game.

And I write on the bitsycard which company earmarked to buy with that particular day's ₷¤5 deposit.

And I put the bitsycard for that day in my wallet.

So I can look at it anytime in the day and remind myself that rent's due.

<a href="uploads/2024-06-05-rents-due-reminder-wallet.jpg"><img src="uploads/2024-06-05-rents-due-reminder-wallet.jpg" width="200"></a>

In conclusion, Im still gonna buy a company every day. It's tedious but bitsycard makes it a game. Rent's due.

<h2>Make it a Game Try To Create Physical Systems and Tokens - Bought a Company 007</h2>

why make it a game?

why treat it like a game like this and test the systems here like this?
Should I double down? Easy up? Hold the course? Tweak it and continue?

An answer can be this:

I'm frustrated from seeing, and doing, systems in my world that make it easy to do the following things:
- make it easy for me to buy a gazingus pin* every day
- make it eazy for me to buy a ¤5 cup of coffee every day
- easy to buy ¤5 wine or beer every day
- make it easy to buy a ¤5 scratch ticket every day.

I want to find a way to replace that with a different habit, one that might feel the same but instead of my money 100% guaranteed gone afterwards, instead my money invested in a legitimate asset afterwards.
And so with a realistic chance on not losing 100% of my money, and at the same time a realistic, even modest, chance of returning money.

So now it is day 6 or so, and however i bumped into stuff that feels like i'm trying to put a square peg in a round hole.

I feel like i'm really taxing the following systems and maybe not in a good way:
- USPS mail delivery
- my local bank (checking account)
- my personal expenses (buying stamps and envelopes and checks (blank checks / personal checks / paper checks) 
- my brokerage (they have to process all these, assuming a person there sees all these come in they'll know I'm constructing doing some kind of game or test likely.
- the envonment using paper envelopes

A note on physical material tokens. I do pay for stamps /delivery, and for checks, and i follow the payment schemes of the bank and the brokerage. So I'm still following all rules. However I feel like I'm using these systems more than other people.

And but should I stop?
Should I double down?
Keep on the same?
Keep on but tweak it a little?

Hmm.
I think the answer for now is I should keep going as long as I am learning.
Keep on and tweak it a little for now.

Today I started drawing a little bitsycard 'receipt' for each ¤5 check that I sent out. To have a gazingus pin to hold in my hand representing each check sent out.
Today I also had to order checks. ¤38 for that. I had factored in cost of stamps and envelopes but not the cost of blank paper checks. But still I press on so far.

A second note on physical material tokens. Each day if I see a paper coffee cup, a beer can, or a paper scratch ticket, it reminds me that those systems also create waste and use material resources too. In fact those tokens I believe are part of what make those systems so popular and appealing. That's why my game in this stage is trying to copy those systems with creating and moving around physical tokens as well too.
I think for now my approach is, have faith that the systems will hold fast, and the tests will pass, and I'll be able to make this a game, at least for a while.

And then once I learned what I wnted to learn, and tested what I wanted to test, then, I could either keep going, or back off, at that point.
This seems like the right approach at this moment in this project.
So thanks to the folks behind the scenes helping with this project.
