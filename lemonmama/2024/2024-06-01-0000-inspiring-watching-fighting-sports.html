<h2>2024-06-01 00：00  -  Inspiring Binge Watching Fighting Sports</h2>
The fighers don't actually want to permanently hurt each other.

It's a game.

The goal is to choke unconscious the other person, or knock unconscious.

Something clicked to start watching UFC fighting.

A favorite podcast, hosts and guests were talking about it. 
IIRC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDzsjZbwwUs">‘PBD Podcast | Ep. 117 | Special Guest: Rashad Evans’</a>

And I watched 75 hours of UFC MMA over 7 months.

It is inspiring in the following ways:

- They are carrying the human race in that they see how tough and violent we can be to each other, excluding intentional permanent injury. 
So pushing the limits to the extreme is inspiring, in a way it is a service to the world because we see how tough humans can be physically and how physically powerful.

- Once inside the ring, race and sex and nationality don't seem to matter as much. 
So it's inspiring, just because you are a certain race or ethnicity or nationality or sex, that doesn't mean one person isn't going to be able to choke out or knock out the other person. 
This is inspiring because it feels more like a meritocracy.

- Also quiet fighters and flashy fighters, still it doesn't mean one can/ will beat the other. There are so many factors.

- Once I learned a fighter was working a day job full time and training outside of that. And So i learned folks of different economic backgrounds can compete.

- Sometimes in a fight, one knocks the other woozy and i see the aggressor hesitate to keep knocking their opponent further senseless. Not always but sometimes. One such time the two were old friends old training partners. However this is not always the case. Sometimes A has B reeling and A doesn't hesitate to keep slamming B. And the referee varies time to time sometimes the referee stops earlier and sometimes later, based on their judgement. One time the announcer said like: "good job by the referee letting the fight keep going after C was dizzy but before C wasn't defending themselves..."

- I enjoy learning the lingo and the strategy techniques attached to the lingo. Especially as I am a noob to this world. 
-- jab, uppercut, left hook.
-- Ground Defense, Full guard, half guard.
-- orthodox stance, southpaw stance, Ground and Pound.
-- Leg kick, body shots, head shots, superman punch, oblique leg kick. 
-- and SO MANY MORE

However as a final note, I must say in the end this isn't a safe sport and I do believe many fighters are becoming permanently injured both on and off the camera, even if that is all or most accidentally. And so it is definitely not for everyone. And also there is so much risk involved. Part of the reason it is such a high level of service, and so inspiring, is because of the danger involved. And also I think the fights I saw were edited and were the best of the best and so this needs to be understood as well in order to be fair to the reality of the situation.

Here are links to a couple of UFC fight videos on espn.com, that I watched:
<a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/2cd533f5-10e7-4c40-9061-08899c5ce0ae">UFC 170: Rousey vs. McMann</a>
<a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/67b9ff91-c24d-42f3-9dad-7bf737ed24ae">UFC 172: Jones vs. Teixeira</a>

In conclusion, it's inspiring watching fighting sports.
