<h2>2024-05-01 00:00  -  Souffrant Vargas Second Listen</h2>

Yes I listened a second time and yes it was worth it.

<a href="https://journeytolaunch.com/episode335/">Episode 335: How To Coast Your Way To Financial Independence, Save 60% of Your Income & Reframe What Retirement Means w/ Ada Vargas</a>

The second time listening to this podcast episode for me the definition of 'coast fi' set in for me.
And so I calculated with my current investments, my coast fi 'retirement age' will be 79 years old.

And I am actually pleased because it means I can stop working for money when I am 79. 

But at the same time it motivates me because actually i do want to "retire" tomorrow (or yesterday) so then it motivates I tell myself, each time I put more money in to my investments, it brings my 'retirement age' down down down earlier than age 79.

However at the same time it is sobering because, actually, no i don't want to be working full time work-for money job when I am 79, nor 69 for that matter.

And so lets say I put in some more thousands of dollars per year/decade.

Then I may be able to live comfortably my investments by age 59.

Of course guess what, it's also sobering. 

Because I want to enjoy my life during my working years too.

So I realize how short my life is and so i need to figure out how to SAVE and INVEST ,  at the SAME TIME AS ENJOYING MY LIFE. starting right NOW THIS SECOND!!!

And the guest Persona Ada Vargas said Ada loves the compound interest calculator government website. I thought this was great. 

And also iirc the guest Persona Ada Vargas said Ada had an epiphany when Ada realized that there may be ways to get 'retirement income' other than literally saving every penny in working years and then literally spending those pennies down during 'retirement years'.

But in any case listening this episode a second time taught me the definition of 'Coast FI' and gave me some good perspective about investing for long term and noticing when investments may provide income enough to stop working.

Previous post on same topic is <a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-12-08_2025-review-souffrant-335-vargas.html">Review： Journey to Launch Podcast Episode 335 with Persona of Ada Vargas</a>

In conclusion, Yes I listened a second time and yes it was worth it.
