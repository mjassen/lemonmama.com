1.)
Summary of what I heard:
I am hearing what they are saying is that, the history of East Indies trade, and old dutch and french influence in old Vietnam and Indonesia, and that continued collateral influence all they way to WWII, and that in turn had collateral influence that continues to today 2024 (U.S.A. interests in Europe in the Middle East, and more)

2.) 
Recap some points I heard:
* Podcast guest the persona of Gerald Celente runs the 'Ttrends Journal'. Gerald is out of The Bronx in New York.
* They talk about The Bronx (NY U.S.A.) and on the podcast the host the persona Robert Kiyosaki says that back in the day (60's and 70's) in The Bronx one should talk like the following: "Talk fast, talk straight, and don't BS anybody"
* They are talking litereally about history. East Indies, Europe, and more.

In my own words, it reminds me that U.S.A. is like a modern day East India Company.
