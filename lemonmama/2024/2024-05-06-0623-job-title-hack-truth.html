<h2>2024-05-06  -  An Ambitious Honest Answer to “So， what do you do for a living﹖”</h2>
"So, what do you do for a living?"

To answer this question, being honest and ambitious at the same time, I can say this:

"I am a professional bookkeeper for small businesses, but I am currently working as a retail store associate to make money."

That was the first iteration.
But there's more. A twist on this it isn't just the job title, it is one's entire current situation can be affirmed and targeted.
Let's say someone wants to know how much I make. I can say:

"I'm the kind of person who makes $75,000 per year, but currently I make $32,000 per year."

I got this hack from Chapter 7 (page 233) of '<a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=%22vicki+robin%22+%22joe+dominguez%22+%22your+money+or+your+life%22#lemonmama.com">Your Money or Your Life</a>' (book by Dominguez and Robin).

This was the example given in the book:
[if someone asks you what you do for a living, you can say] "... I am a teacher but currently I'm writing computer programs to make money..."

LOVE THIS HACK. Not even a hack. More than a hack, not optional, Just truth. LOVE IT. So I did it then iterated it and made it my own.

Some say fake it until you make it.

Like the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4DnjpaA7Uhs6NZSpuFqb2t">PBD Podcast | Ep 391</a> plays a clip of the persona of The Rock and in the clip persona of The Rock re-frames the question and answers the re-framed question. Nice.

Like in the movie <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/zootopia/1QOxldhm1sKg">Zootopia</a> the persona the fox Nick Wilde coaches the rabbit persona Judy Hopps how to field questions from the media by re-framing them.

It's like persona Covey of <a href="https://www.alibris.com/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People/book/66433">The 7 Habits</a> fame says, there is the first creation then there is the second creation.

They say the highest performers (athletes, etc.) spend time envisioning and meditating before the game/event, imagining how they will perform and how calm they will be and how they will succeed.

One has to envision one's success first, then one can proceed to enact(embody) that successful image after that.

In conclusion, this is a job title hack that is honest and ambitious at the same time.
