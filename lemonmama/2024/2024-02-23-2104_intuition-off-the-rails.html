2024-02-23 2104 - Intuition Off The Rails [成人 explicit]


A Thought.

Discerned folks in the world at large.

Are using intuition to decide life decisions.

And once folks get 30% of needed information then they decide huge decisions.

I have seen it that folks just get 30% of information.

Then they push forward and push their agenda.

Then sometimes they sell and the buyer buys. 

Congratulations.

Now you have done maybe 60% of the work.

Now pass on to the people to do the 40% of the work.

the end.

amazing.

for better or worse.





OK WHAT IS THE TAKE-AWAY?!!??

The point is that this is life.

Folks are steamrolling, pushing, and leveraging, and selling, with 30% of the information.

And other folks are left holding the bag.


This is a tale as old as time.

And I just realized it.

So I need to FUCKING PAY ATTENTION because it affects me.

And I can navigate my own fortune, wealth, based on what folks are leveraging and etc.

And I need to have allies and get with my tribe and realize who's on my allies/tribe and who's not on my allies/tribe, and act in alignment with my allies/tribe and don't FUCK AROUND wasting effort unless it is benefitting my allies/tribe.
And of course do welcome folks to join my allies/tribe too. HOwever that is on its own cadence.
And but the cadence of day to day life is a different cadence. It can be raw, it can be like warfare.


sigh.

fin.
