<h2>Not Not Enjoying Calling People Out</h2>
Something clicks.

My friend says something and then within the next 5 minutes I realize it isn't true.

It is a small lie added in passing to add emphasis and pursuade me to agree with them on the other separate main issue at this moment.

Another 5 minutes go by.

Then I can literally feel my stomach cramping up.

And I put the pieces together.

My friend fibbs to push their agenda, then I realize that, then I hold my tongue, then my stomach starts cramping up. All within about 10mins. time.

At this moment something clicks. 

And I realize this pattern has happened to me many times before, but I didn't do anything about it all those many times.

However, this time is different.

I realize this now and I go and call them out on it.

It doesn't feel great calling someone a liar.

This time it also doesn't feel great.

Folks will often resent others for calling them out, even if folks had lied.

But what does feel good is my stomach cramp going away instantly after I call someone out for frosting me over.

That feels good.

And so it's a new paradigm.

The point is now I enjoy pain avoidance by calling people out without delay when they lie to me.

So you better believe I'm going to bring it to someone's attention when someone misleads me.

Nice having a new superpower.

However.

I believe this opens up a whole new set of challenges, for example folks' egos are sensitive and also people sometimes are in a rush and sometimes something is just trivial and not that important.

A weird thing is I can't even say when or how I ended up down the path of not recognizing when people were misleading me, nor when or how I became a character who failed to call people out when this happened.
But I guess that matters less, and what matters more is getting better character habits and awareness of other peoples and these situations ongoing.

In conclusion, this is the day I do not not enjoy calling people out. Holding people accountable to be honest and have integrity, it's still not enjoyable in and of itself, mostly is a difficult thing to surf. However at this point it's a lot better than the alternative, it's a lot better than physical illness and so it's not an option here.
