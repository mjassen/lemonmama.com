2024-02-08 1157  -  They All Needed Deleting

The long blog draft of how smartphone and website mind control, summarized, went something like this:

how I never asked to be logged in to all the things.
how I am getting a dumbphone.
how it's time for face-to-face meetings.
how addicted to smartphone and social media etc.
how deleting apps from phone etc.
removing address book entries from phone etc.
signing out from iCloud etc.
resetting smartphone to factory default 1x per month etc. etc.


And that's it.
All of it.

In other words, yes, do all of this. 
Logout and reset and detach of all the logged-in things.

We control our phone, our phone doesn't control us.

In-person, voice call, and plaintext email. 

That's it really.

In hindsight it took me months to detox pretty far.

And now detoxed pretty good.

Weird how obvious it is in hindsight.

The detox needs to be high level and severe.

I could rant all I want about deleting so many individual low-level apps and logins.

But in the end, they all needed deleting.

Just in-person and dumbphone voice call and plaintext email remain.

Weird.
