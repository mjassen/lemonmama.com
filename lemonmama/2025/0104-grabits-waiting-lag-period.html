<h2>Grabits and Waiting Out the Lag Period</h2>
2025-03-12 

by Morgan Jassen

They call this 'wait out the lag period' in this podcast episode.

At the 17m. 50s. mark they are saying "wait out the lag period".

Before that, I had called it 'grabit'.

And I had then heard it called the 'Zone of Disruption'
