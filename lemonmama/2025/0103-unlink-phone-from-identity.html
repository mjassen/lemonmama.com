<h2>#0103 - Unlink Phone And Number From Identity - Software Privacy Security Identity 001</h2>

news flash.

2024 U.S.A. humans assume each earthling has (1x smartphone + phone number), and only 1x, and that (1x smartphone + phone number) is linked to the person's identity.

wow.

it just hits me so hard this week.

because I never signed up for this.

I was signed on by others.

as a requirement to join a service, then another service, then another.

and so.

how to go?

i feel like I must break this.

I must unlink my identity 100% from my (1x smartphone + phone number).

so.

here are some ways I propose:

1.) refuse any service that requires a phone number in order to sign up.
2.) get two(2) phone numbers. one I only use to link to my identities/profiles/2fas. The other one I use as a phone for calling/data connection/ internet/ etc.
3.) once per ten months, get a new phone numbers (or two new phone numbers). This way I will naturally mimimize my attaching my identity to my phone numbers. because i know i plan to get a new number in the next 10 months anyway.
4.) get a phone number and it lives on the counter at home. no exceptions. like a land line. and so it is more linked to my home address than it is to me nor to my location.
5.) share (or borrow) a (phone + phone number) whenever I need one. so if i'm sharing a phone and i know someone else will have access to that phone too at any given time. then it means that i will treat it less privately. not linked 1:1 to my identity. rather linked 1:many to the phone plus (mine and others' identity).


yesss! get creative.
any/all of these will break, or start to break, my linking of my phone to my identity.

In conclusion, go do it, go unlink phone and number from identity.
