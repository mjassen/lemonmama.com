<h2>#0074 - Free Speech Begets Free Speech</h2>

Here is the quote:

“The price you pay for free speech is, free speech.” 

Said by persona Adam Sosnick, at the (56m. 29s.mark)

When he and the PBD Podcast Squad are talking about getting banned from YouTube.

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1kGUXSRTLf6ykucUO1fleM">PBD PODCAST episode #467</a>

I love this quote.

Because it is stated so concisely.

And the speaker persona Sosnick, says it so well in this context in this podcast episode.

In conclusion, free speech begets free speech.

<h2>#0072 - Wall Graph of Your Life 001</h2>

I made thing.

I made this budget chart called <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=%22vicki+robin%22+%22joe+dominguez%22+%22your+money+or+your+life%22#lemonmama.com">wall graph of your life</a>.

I learned thing.

Two immediate notes, what I learned, doing this iteration of updating my wall graph of your life.

1.) It is a cash flow statement.
2.) I want to only include my own personal income (not others from shared accounts in my household).
2.b.) I want to include all expenses (including others from shared accounts in my household).

For 2. and 3. above, my reasons are, this is what I have control over. I have control over my income not others', and I have no control over no one's spending from shared accounts so i should assume the shared accounts will all be spent and the shared bills will all be paid immediately or due immedidately. 

Side note: It's a cash flow statement. That makes me a bookkeeper.

<a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-07-17_2148-make-business-do-it.html">I'm a bookkeeper!</a>

Ok so now i did 6 months so far, november to april.

Picture of wall graph here:

<a href="uploads/2025-01-01-wall-graph-your-life.jpg"><img src="uploads/2025-01-01-wall-graph-your-life.jpg" width="150"></a>

In conclusion, This time updating my wall graph budget, I learned it's a cash flow statement. And I learned what income and expenses I want to include on the chart, and which I want to exclude from the chart.
