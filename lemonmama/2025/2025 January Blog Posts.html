<h2>#0080 - Reinvest Dividends Tax Free - Technical Investing 001</h2>
The Thing About This podcast episode is they taught me that drip plans are tax free.

This answered my long-time unasked question.

To me this means that the reinvested dividend is not taxed, because it is reinvested. 

Good to know!

At the 27m:20s mark, they say: "...reinvest... drip plans dividend reinvestmen plans... cost free tax free... "

(they keep talking about this until at least the 29m:08s mark)

<h2>#0079 - Past The Solstice</h2>
Got this feeling.

Then checked sunrise/set chart.

We are past the summer solstice 2024.

It is a beautiful, sunny, hot humid day out.

And yet I just got this feeling.

And it turns out the days have started getting shorter.

Wow.

It's amazing.

Living in Massachusetts it is like this.

The thing is, I'd consider this to be mid summer.

Maybe even juuuust EARLY midsummer.

And yet the days are gettting shorter.

It's like the earth is a huge rotisserie chicken.

And we've been roasting.

We're hot now.

But we're gonna cool down.

And it reminds me how now in 2024 based on my total knowledge.

This is the golden age of humanity.

And signs point to collapses of humanity coming in the near future.

I guess I should surf gratitude for being alive now.

<h2>#0078 - Apple Unprompted Prompts Login - Dark Patterns 001</h2>

apple unprompted prompts to login apple id

apple randomly unprompted, prompts me to log in to apple id. 
no reason given.
just prompts me to log in.
and the choices are dark pattern:

稍後再說 (later)
設定 (go to settings)

-
"...    Apple ID驗證在「設定」中輸入
T     ...@... ....com    BIT •

<h2>#0076 - Massachusetts Man Discovers New Talent, Promotes Music Artist's Songs to His Friends</h2>

"I heard this fresh voice this beautiful song".

Morgan Jassen, a 43-year old white man who wears a beard, said.

Picture of Mr. Jassen here:

<img src="../../morgan/mo2_300px.jpeg">

"I just had to know who was singing this."

According to Mr. Jassen he has a history of finding fresh new sounds, songs, and singers, even before anyone else, including his friends, have heard of them. 

To this point, Mr. Jassen told us:

"I hadn't been listening for new music for a while, then I turned on the radio and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2uqYupMHANxnwgeiXTZXzd">“Austin” by Dasha</a> was playing on the number 22 slot of the countdown."

Mr. Jassen says he still remembers the first time he heard "Austin" by Dasha on the radio.

"I told my friend I discovered this new talented artist and they had to hear this song!"

When asked to comment, Mr. Jassen's friend said yeah, they heard the Dasha Song last year.
 
In our interview, still nodding to the beat and singing, Mr. Jassen made the following prediction: "I think this one could get to #1 on the charts, I bet you it will at least be higher on the charts next week.”

Finally, we asked Mr. Jassen what genres of music he likes to which he commented: 
“I like all different kinds of music, I listen to everything.”

<h2>#0075 - [Nashoba][Rental][Person].[com] Biz Idea Remix - Odd Jobs Business Idea 002</h2>

DO IT NOW PUT UP THE WEBSITE NOW!!! 
get first sale now!! 
get first rental-person partner now!!
complete first assignment now!

DOO IT!!!

Start with the previous ideas "Odd Jobs Business Idea"
Then add on to the previous ideas more "Rental Person" feel.
So __deliberately__ make the services provided __more vague__.
We are not necessarily skilled you see.
We are mainly there for odd support and to be an extra pair of eyeballs, an extra head brain, extra heart, extra intuition, extra common sense, an exta set of hands, a witness. etc.

see previous ideas here:
<a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2024/0026%20Odd%20Jobs%20Business%20Idea.html">#0026 Odd Jobs Business Idea</a>

Ok so start with the previous ideas, then generalize it down to include:
- Work __In Pairs Only__   NO EXCEPTIONS. EVER. (cancel the job unless both rental-person partners show up)  <--- important becuase "support support"
- Rental Person
- Moral Support
- odd jobs
- labor/mover/transporter
- double down on "Hotel Concierge" feel (general)
- Double down on "Personal Assistant" feel (general.
- double down on "Administrative Assistant" feel (general)
- writing services.              writing. that's it. keep it general.
- odd jobs
- side note: get an attorney ready. because at some point we will be sued. (sadly this is business reality in America...)
- side note: get a bookkeeper. because at some point we will need to organize finances.
- Second Opinion
- Rental-Person 'Free Advice' feel (free advice but paid since it is a rental-person)
- An ear to talk to
- did i mention, odd jobs? odd jobs.
- side note: nothing illegal, nothing unethical.
- side note: at will. clients or rental-person can fire each other any time. or decide not to accept/solicit each other at any time. or can ask to work with a different individual client / rental-person any time. we aren't necessarily skilled, so, it matters a lot the degree the relationship gels or not.
- Making referrals to actual professionals (niche/expert/licensed etc.)         (ironic right, we are hired for our ability to decide to refer you to an expert (if we can't do the job/task))
- general sales salesperson
- tech support / customer support feel
- librarian / reference desk feel
- lite bodyguard / lite bouncer feel / lite security feel (though likely would have to be very lite. like in the way that harry potter does security. only when needed only to protect his friends (or to protect wizardkind/humankind) etc.)

put this up on e.g. [Nashoba][Rental][Person].[com]
then get some colleagues/friends/peers of mine to help me
then get our first paying client
then the next 
then the next...

note: repeat customers will ofc be good.
note: this is 2025. AIs and robots do a lot of menial work. but, and but so, personal assistants will be needed more by more people. and come in high demand. 

our handbook for rental people can be like:
- Use your good judgement.
- no assholes
- good vibes only
- (best effort) / (DIY) / (as-is) vibes. We're not slaves and maybe not servants per se. More like partners envisioned. In other words, collaborative Service mindset, but not 'gofer' type of servants. Tasks sure, burnout gofer service is a no, but sustainable gofer service is a go.
- perl approach. do what works in one line of code is fine.
- vibes similar to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128183600-rental-person-who-does-nothing">Rental Person Who Does Nothing</a> book by Morimoto.

note: our rental people organization envisioned to use any/all of the following structure feel:
'employee-owned' / 
'co-op' / 
public-company / 
b-corp / 
conscious-capitalism 

feel to it.

Side note. ^these are service sales ideas. for goods sales ideas see: ...lemonmama_drafts/2024 and onwards/retired/2024-06-12 0518 gamify it more brick and mortar.txt

In conclusion, do it. do it now. put up the website. get the firsrt sale. get the first rental-person-partner. complete the first project. Do the next step in the rental-person odd jobs business idea.

<h2>#0074 - Free Speech Begets Free Speech</h2>

Here is the quote:

“The price you pay for free speech is, free speech.” 

Said by persona Adam Sosnick, at the (56m. 29s.mark)

When he and the PBD Podcast Squad are talking about getting banned from YouTube.

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1kGUXSRTLf6ykucUO1fleM">PBD PODCAST episode #467</a>

I love this quote.

First because it's so true.
The main person who can censor me, is me.
In other words, if nobody censors themself, then, nobody will be censored.
So what any one individual can do, and also any group of people can do, is to frequently speak their mind, speak truth, and speak truth to power.
However there is also a price to pay.
For example as history shows many times, and for example, sometimes person 1 jails or kills person 2 for speaking truth that goes against person 1's ideology, or vice-versa.
 
Second because in this context in this quote it is stated so concisely, and the speaker persona Sosnick, talking with his crew, says it so well in this podcast episode.

In conclusion, free speech begets free speech.

<h2>#0072 - Wall Graph of Your Life 001</h2>

I made thing.

I made this budget chart called <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=%22vicki+robin%22+%22joe+dominguez%22+%22your+money+or+your+life%22#lemonmama.com">wall graph of your life</a>.

I learned thing.

Two immediate notes, what I learned, doing this iteration of updating my wall graph of your life.

1.) It is a cash flow statement.
2.) I want to only include my own personal income (not others from shared accounts in my household).
2.b.) I want to include all expenses (including others from shared accounts in my household).

For 2. and 3. above, my reasons are, this is what I have control over. I have control over my income not others', and I have no control over no one's spending from shared accounts so i should assume the shared accounts will all be spent and the shared bills will all be paid immediately or due immedidately. 

Side note: It's a cash flow statement. That makes me a bookkeeper.

<a href="https://lemonmama.com/lemonmama/2023/2023-07-17_2148-make-business-do-it.html">I'm a bookkeeper!</a>

Ok so now i did 6 months so far, november to april.

Picture of wall graph here:

<a href="uploads/2025-01-01-wall-graph-your-life.jpg"><img src="uploads/2025-01-01-wall-graph-your-life.jpg" width="150"></a>

In conclusion, This time updating my wall graph budget, I learned it's a cash flow statement. And I learned what income and expenses I want to include on the chart, and which I want to exclude from the chart.
