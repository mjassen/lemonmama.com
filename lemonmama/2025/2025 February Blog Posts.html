<h2>#0081 - Javascript Peer to Peer App Works to Send Message Between Browsers Including Across Networks and Across Devices</h2>
Why can't i just send a message from my web browser to any other web browser in the world?
Like just using a free non-huge web browser app?
Like a javascript app?
Or even a cross-platform small free text messaging app?
This is the year 2024.
And so I searched it up a bunch.

Around the same time I came across <a href="https://jami.net/">Jami</a>, briar, quiet, <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>, etc.

Also found this browser based javascript app, which is the subject of this blog post and the screenshots below.

Spoiler alert, it works! and it's powerful.

<a href="https://jmcker.github.io/Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/">https://jmcker.github.io/Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/</a>

The verdict:
yes p2p message sent in browser WORKS across networks

p2p message in browser WORKS on same wifi network AND on separate internet networks

Here is a link where I came across this:
<a href="https://peerjs.com/examples">https://peerjs.com/examples</a>
https://jmcker.github.io/Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/

this 'jmcker...' one did allow me to send a message under folloiwng conditions:

YES like this:
FROM iphone safari via WiFi (not via cell data)
TO firefox on Windows 10.

YES like this:
FROM firefox windows 10 TO firefox windows 10 on same computer

NO like this:
FROM firefox on windows to firefox on ubuntu vm

YES FROM safari iPhone (via T-Mobile cellular data) TO Windows 10 Firefox (via WiFi hooked to Comcast land cable internet connection)


In short, what I did was on 'device/browser A', browse to the ...Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/ page, initiate an app in my browser, then took the address/identifier and sent that to my other 'device/browser B' via another channel, and used that address to connect from browser B back to browser A and send a message both ways from B to A and another message from A to B.

So, in short, it works.

In conclusion, this javascript app worked to send messages peer-to-peer from one device/browser to a second device/browser. It seemed pretty slick and nice initially so I thought to blog it out here.
