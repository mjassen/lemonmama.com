<h2>#0084 - Companies People Talking To Anyone But Me About Me</h2>
I'm tuning in to this more and more.

It's a thing i'm noticing.

In short, bosses and colleagues talk more about my performance and role to others, than to me.

Looking back at pretty much every company I ever worked for now.

So shame on me for tuning in to this more now.

I think this is an USA company, company culture thing.

The weird thing is its all done so silently and covertly.

This is my excuse for not tuning into it more in the past two decades or so.

Instead, it's silent.

For example, a colleague makes a comment about my role or about my performance, and inside that comment, a context clue says that they were just talking about this with my boss.

Another example, a colleague says that the boss is ready to change my role responsibilities, even though my boss never mentioned that to me. And then a day later my boss does mention that to me.

There are literally dozens of examples across a dozen companies in my past, where my ears were ringing like this.

These two aren't even the best, i can think of more better ones.

It centers around the feeling that instead of talking to ME first, or most frequently, or most candidly, about my performance and my role. 

My colleagues and bosses talk with each other more frequently than with me, about my performance.

They talk first with each other not first with me, about my performance.

They talk with each other more candidly than with me, about my job role.


So then what did I think was happening in the past decades when my ears were ringing?



I think I told myself that if it were important, and it were about me, then my peers would come to me first about it.

I thought they'd come to me most frequently about it.

I thought for stuff about my role and performance that peers would tell me most candidly and frankly and directly about my performance, moreso than talking to someone else more frankly about my performance.


Now I'm tuning in more to how subtle and silent and indirect, americans talk about their, and my, performance and role and goals and plans in the workplace.

It's real. 

This is how my, and our, careers and jobs and roles and performance is being steered and decided.

And so, actually, one can't not tune in to this.

It's not an option to not pay attention to subtle silent comments regarding one's workplace role and one's workplace perfromance.


In conclusion, bosses and colleagues talking more candidly and directly and frequently about my performance and my role to each other, than to me.




update:
ok its more  than that.

Quick story. my closest colleague Dazzle Junior who is really professional.
they started before me and were level 2 /superviser when i arrived at the company.
i am level 1 /associate they are level 2 /supervisor.
half a year passes they are killing it.
one day i overheard two of my other colleagues talking to each other saying that Dazzle Junior got promoted to level 3/assistant manager.
And i thought, huh, is that true, first I heard of it.
Then fast forward about 3 more months later. I still haven't heard more via any direct communication.
But now I see on a shared team schedule that person listed as level 3/assistant manager.

/end quick story.


The point is, that, the point is that how can I explain the subtlety.

it's so silent, so subtle.

It's not that it feels like I'm not offered a seat at the table.

It's that i feel I don't know there is a table.

Feels like No one at level 1/associate talks about any table.

Feels like no one at level 1 knows that there is a table nor that decisions are made at the table.

feels like level 1 doesn't know that sometimes, some people are offered a seat at this table either. This existent, decicion-making-place of a table.

People at level 1 grumble about new tasks coming down from the top.

Feels like No one at level 1/associate is ever asked for any input or opinions.

this is how it feels.

I learned that there is a table and that people are invited to the table and that the table is where decisions are made, through urban legend. And on a podcast that I listened to in passing.


Question: is this taught at school?
I mean even in business school where business operations are studied.
Is it all laid out clearly and directly levels of management and how to arrange groups and levels of management and how to [not] invite people in there, and how this is the place, caled the table, to make business decisions, and how to flow those decisions down one-directionally down and how important it is to never talk about the existence of the table when level 1 colleagues are around?

And how to make sure to never ask level 1 colleagues for any input?

And how to make sure to never talk withh level 1 colleagues or reports about their performance with them directly?

And how to make sure to discuss performance of a level 1 colleague, lets call them Tantrum Gem with other people at some detailed length enought to understand Tantrum Gem's performance and goals and roles and strengths and weaknesses.

And then if desired for level 1 report Tantrum Gem to take on more responsibility, first talk in depth with it about someone who's not Tantrum Gem, second don't talk to Tantrum Gem about it ahead of time, third call a meeting with Tantrum Gem about it but don't tell them what the meeting's about neither before during nor after.
Fourth during the meeting very breifly and indirectly inform Tantrum Gem what role you want them to do now different than in past, and a few tasks associated with that role.
Fifth don't mention to Tantrum Gem that this is an offer to get promoted nor that there will be any job title change related.
Sixth don't mention to Tantrum Gem that they can or should drop any role responsibilities from their old job role.
Seventh don't ask Tantrum Gem their input about any of this at any time before during or after. Only do try to read Tantrum Gem's facial and body language to try and guess how Tantrum Gem might be feeling about this.
Seven-and-halfth don't ever give Tantrum Gem any of this in writing. This is a verbal only meeting where it's not written down expectations nor roles nor goals nor changes that are being made.
Eighth end the meeting and then don't check back with Tantrum Gem with any formal meeting ever again about this.
Ninth do in passing informally mention to Tantrum Gem once per month about how they aren't doing a particular task associated with the new role.
Tenth repeat about 3 times in the next 6 months slipping a few hints to Tantrum Gem that they aren't doing a particular task, never mentioning that it's the role that Tantrum Gem is also failing at, also never mentioning at a high level the name of the role nor talking directly nor in depth about it.
Eleventh do talk at length with different colleagues in private very specifically and in great detail about how Tantrum Gem is failing a Tantrum Gem's new role and at goals associated with their new role, and how you already talked with Tantrum Gem about this multiple times and how it's time to maybe start looking for someone else to do the role instead.


Meanwhile Tantrum Gem hasn't yet gotten it.
Tantrum Gem doesn't get it that they already got offered a promotion nor that they accepted the promotion nor what the exact role and title and deliverables are of that promotion nor that they have now been failing at the promotion for 6 months, nor that they have been failing at all at a promotion.


The point is, the communication of my role and performance, from my boss to me, is indirect and non-candid and infrequent. 
Whereas at the same time, my boss talks with my other colleagues about my role and performance freely.


So ironic.

I seem a bit bitter about this.

Because it is a pattern that has been happening around me for decades.

And I never caught on very well.

But the ironic thing is, by its very nature, it is made harder to grasp.

The fact that it is subtle, covert, indirect, infrequent, non-candid.

That makes it harder to discern.

And but the ironic thing is that, it is way more important than simple daily items of life. 

So in my mind I had thought, assumed, that folks would be more direct and frank and frequent about it.

But you know shame on me.


It turns out that this may just be human nature, and it's time for me to learn a big lesson late in life.

The bigger and more important the item and topic, humans may be more inderect and covert and silent and infrequent about it.


That's the point.



It makes snse though.
Because with more surface area, many humans try to leverage these more.
For example if bosses invited reports to talk frequently and more directly about their role/performance, I think the half of humans who are more clever and manipulative about this type of things, would take those as extra opportunities to lobby and sell themselves and leverage themselves forward.

Pirates. 
Whereas Bumpkins would just be more passive and wait for direct frequent communications from their bosses.

amazing the bumpkin/pirate rurul/urban divide strikes again.


but guess what? it's not a dichotomy.
there are all sorts. it's a spectrum of pirate-to-bumpkin spectrum. and folks can learn how to be more piratey or learn how to be more bumpkiny and folks can choose how to act on a certain situation diffrently dynamically.


In conclusion, these have been musings on how bosses and colleagues talk more candidly and directly and frequently about my performance and my role to each other, than to me.

<h2>#0083 - Dogs Doing Jiu-Jitsu</h2>
Did you know dogs invented jiu-jitsu?

I saw them in the park.

They wrestle, and they tumble, and they roll.

Here is a public domain picture I found online of dogs doing Jiu-Jitsu:

<h2>#0082 - Once Again Joanna Wang Describes My Life</h2>
Somehow Joanna Wang song once again describes my life.

This one is like somehow blues but lullaby.

Sounds like JW is singing about me saying goodbye to my younger self, frankly.

How did she know?

<h2>#0081 - Javascript Peer to Peer App Works to Send Message Between Browsers Including Across Networks and Across Devices</h2>
Why can't i just send a message from my web browser to any other web browser in the world?
Like just using a free non-huge web browser app?
Like a javascript app?
Or even a cross-platform small free text messaging app?
This is the year 2024.
And so I searched it up a bunch.

Around the same time I came across <a href="https://jami.net/">Jami</a>, briar, quiet, <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>, etc.

Also found this browser based javascript app, which is the subject of this blog post and the screenshots below.

Spoiler alert, it works! and it's powerful.

<a href="https://jmcker.github.io/Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/">https://jmcker.github.io/Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/</a>

The verdict:
yes p2p message sent in browser WORKS across networks

p2p message in browser WORKS on same wifi network AND on separate internet networks

Here is a link where I came across this:
<a href="https://peerjs.com/examples">https://peerjs.com/examples</a>
https://jmcker.github.io/Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/

this 'jmcker...' one did allow me to send a message under folloiwng conditions:

YES like this:
FROM iphone safari via WiFi (not via cell data)
TO firefox on Windows 10.

YES like this:
FROM firefox windows 10 TO firefox windows 10 on same computer

NO like this:
FROM firefox on windows to firefox on ubuntu vm

YES FROM safari iPhone (via T-Mobile cellular data) TO Windows 10 Firefox (via WiFi hooked to Comcast land cable internet connection)


In short, what I did was on 'device/browser A', browse to the ...Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System/ page, initiate an app in my browser, then took the address/identifier and sent that to my other 'device/browser B' via another channel, and used that address to connect from browser B back to browser A and send a message both ways from B to A and another message from A to B.

So, in short, it works.

Pictures here:

Picture 1 of 3:
<a href="uploads/2025-02-02-jmcker-p2p-cue-system-01.jpg"><img src="uploads/2025-02-02-jmcker-p2p-cue-system-01.jpg" width="300"></a>

          Picture 2 of 3:
          <a href="uploads/2025-02-02-jmcker-p2p-cue-system-02.jpg"><img src="uploads/2025-02-02-jmcker-p2p-cue-system-02.jpg" width="225"></a>

Picture 3 of 3:

In conclusion, this javascript app worked to send messages peer-to-peer from one device/browser to a second device/browser. It seemed pretty slick and nice initially so I thought to blog it out here.
