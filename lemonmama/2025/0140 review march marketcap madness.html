Perhaps you are curious what well known company this is? Then you may want to go have a listen to these podcast episodes to find out! It's a benefit of listening to these episodes, that you can learn some interesting trivia about some interesting public companies!</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">2.)</p><p class="P4">I loved the banter and the wide ranging topics the host and guests talk as they play "the market cap game show". Even the side topics, the topics that they mention in passing.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">3.)</p><p class="P4">Despite all the chit-chat, they do still stay focused on guessing the market capitalization for many companies. At least 10 companies per episode, so 30 companies discussed between the three episodes. And so I appreciated learning some about these companies, at least about the market cap of each of the companies.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">4.)  </p><p class="P4">At one point they were talking about strong or iconic brands. It made me think nostalgic from some of my own favorite strong companies brands throughout my life. disney, honda, visa, walmart, UPS, etc., etc. They didn't mention all of these companies, however, just listening, i was inspired to think of what companies, and brands especially, in my own life, that have inspired me across the years.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">5.)</p><p class="P4">During one of the three episodes, they happened to talk, in any case talked, about at least a couple of REITs. (Real Estate Investment Trusts). And this time, as in previous episodes iirc, the host the persona David Gardner reminded us that one constraint of a REIT is that, a REIT is required to pay 90% of its profits as dividends to shareholders, or something like that. On this note I, Morgan, pause and consider once again, should I be thinking of investing more in any REIT? As it sounds like that could be an impressive formula, depending on how well (or poorly) the particular REIT is run.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">Here are links to all three episodes, overall I do recommend anyone to lisen, who enjoys talking about public companies, who likes listening to a game show and playing along with a game show, and who likes to listen to the musings of personas who can take themselves seriously, while at the same time somehow playfully and publicly repeatedly referring to themselves as "Fools"! </p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">Links to the 3x podcast episodes are here:</p><p class="P4">I.)  2025 March Market Cap Madness: Andy vs. Matt  |  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3x4JjqQIVa66mtXbcHvzST" class="Internet_20_link">https://open.spotify.com/episode/3x4JjqQIVa66mtXbcHvzST</a></p><p class="P4">II.)  2025 March Market Cap Madness: Bill vs. Emily  |  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Hd2GT22C94m9mrEa5cdnh" class="Internet_20_link">https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Hd2GT22C94m9mrEa5cdnh</a></p><p class="P4">III.)  2025 March Market Cap Madness Championship: Andy v.
