<h2>#0092 - Align Finance With Social Remix</h2>
'You should align your financial life with your social life'
(paraphrasing)
-heard on one of my main podcasts in the last year or two in 2024 iirc


Ever since i heard this it feels true to me.

and so i'm iterating in my head to try and find how to do better at this.

I think it means the following:
You should socialize with the same people you do business with, and vice versa.


It just makes so much sense.

And so I'm thinking how can i aligne these mre for myself?

I think i can do the following:
- Join a gym where my (work colleagues) also go.
- Join a gym where my (next door neighbors) also go.

- Work where my (next door neighbors) do.
- Work where my (gym buddies) do.

said otherwise:
- Live where my (gym buddies) do.
- Live where my (work colleagues) do.


Another example:

- for (the coffee shop where i hang out), work there too.
- for (the coffee shop where i hang out), go to the one where my (gym buddies) do.
- for (the coffee shop where i hang out), go to the one where my (next door neighbors) also go.


Another example:
- For my toastmasters club, go to the club where my (gym buddies) do.
- For my toastmasters club, go to the club where my (next door neigbors) also go.
- For my toastmasters club, go to the club where my (work colleagues) also go.


Another example:
- For (work colleagues), also go to the same (gym) as them.
- For (work colleagues), also live in the same (neigborhood) as them.
- For (work colleagues), also go to the same (coffee shop) as them.
- For (work colleagues), also go to the same (toastmasters club) as them.



You get the point.


DO IT. DOOOO IT.
