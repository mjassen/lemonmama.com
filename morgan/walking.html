I'm Going Walking, Public Is Welcome To Join.


****** GENERAL DETAILS: ******
I'm going walking around West Acton MA town, most M+W+F nights Starting at 7pm. 
Public is welcome to join. 
The goal is to get exercise and be social, and in doing so to be healthier and wealthier, wiser and smarter, and happier and richer.
If you want to join me for a walking and talking social session then I look forward to seeing you there. 
The main rule for attendees is good judgement, and best effort, for civil and respect.
The plan is that I will pause for a few minutes at this address before departing at 7pm sharp for a walk around town, about 1.5 miles. Please do join me if you want to network, chat, socialize on this walk.
And so here's how to find me in-person on a regular basis:
