<h3 id="2023-03-31_1845-remix-llcs-bookkeeping-s1e1"><a href="./2023-q1-blog.html#2023-03-31_1845-remix-llcs-bookkeeping-s1e1">“Pilot Raspberry” Remix: Niche And Career is LLCs and Bookkeeping: Inaugural Post - Season 1 Episode 1</a></h3>

My new niche, and my career for the next 5 to 10 years is going to be, and I'm also going to be blogging about this is: bookkeeping for LLCs and learning bookkeeping for LLCs.

Rough plans:

Start each of the following series:

1.) 1-on-1 in-person networking meetings with "llcs bookkeeping" folks 
2.) meetup group for "llcs bookkeeping" 
3.) youtube channel for "llcs bookkeeping" 
4.) podcast for "llcs bookkeeping" 
5.) blog series for "llcs bookkeeping" 
6.) online didcussion forum for "llcs bookkeeping" 
7.) book group for "llcs bookkeeping" 
8.) blog book reviews of "llcs bookkeeping"

Continued goals and benchmarks for bookkeeping for LLCs and inaugural blog post:

9.) OK this here is the inaugural blog post for bookkeeping for LLCs. It lays out a big ambitious 10 year plan.
10.) This inaugural post is going to be on lemonmama.com, series, and this is season 1 episode 1. 

And it's going to lay out the following further benchmarks:

11.) Benchmark: when for the first time I interviewed someone who did bookkeeping for LLCs.
12.) Benchmark: I will get a domain name that's like 'bookkeepingforllcs.com' (or something similar, whatever's available and matches)

More on becoming a bookkeeper.

13.) Benchmark: so each year on March 31, I will re-blog and recap my anniversary of when I "became a bookkeeper". (That's today, this blog post marks the day I "Became a bookkeeper"
14. And so then in March 31 of 2033, that will be my 10 year anniversary and I'll say I have been a bookkeeper for 10 years based on that metric.
15.) Another benchmark is when I get my first paying gig as a bookkeeper.
16.) Another benchmark is whenever I pass a bookkeeping certification course.

In Conclusion, this blog post marks the day I became a bookkeeper and the start of a series of learning about bookkeeping and bookkeeping for LLCs.
