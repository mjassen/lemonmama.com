<span style="font-size: 30px;">I'm Going Walking</span>

I'm going walking around town.

I call this "Precious Walking"
  
The goal is to get exercise and be social, in other words, is to be healthier and wealthier, wiser and smarter, and happier and richer.

This time is precious because to invite kindred spirits to spend time together socializing, and also it doesn't cost any money so it conserves our life energy.

The main rule for Precious Walking is good judgement, and best effort, for civil and respect.

Precious Walking can be called 'Before After Work Social Time'.

Meeting times for Precious Walking can be daily, should meet at the starting point and depart promptly, and walking for a mile or three.

Which town/map to choose, is which is closest for the main core Precious Walkers of this group. If it's sparked from work colleagues, then reasonable to choose the route near the workplace. If sparked from home, logical to choose the route near home.

But a trait of Precious Walking is, groups can cross over. So group sparked from work colleagues can invite family members walking too. Group sparked from next-door neighbors can invite work colleagues too.

Which time to choose, envisioned is before work or after work. Because vision is to add more people into the group later, and main factor for this is choosing time before/after work. For example for morning then (6:00am or 6:30am) or for night then (7:30pm or 8:00pm)

Also, a distinctive trait about Precious Walking, is that it is held in a neutral zone. Like in town, in public view.
Slightly removed from home/work turf, still close to home/work turf. What this does is makes it a 'third place' so it is close to home/work but there is still a boundary separating it from home/work.
It means that you are meeting together, but at the same time each is still independent for themself.
On the sidewalk or equivalent, that represents public free space.
It's a public forum.

A trait of Precious Walking is, lots of people can attend, for example, work colleagues, family, neighbor, kids, dogs, friends, retired folks, and more. After all since it is a public forum, acquaintences and strangers may want to join in, so folks going Precious Walking will have to be ready for some very real socializing. This is especially where The main rule for Precious Walking, i.e. using good judgement, will need to be exercised.
