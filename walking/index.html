<span style="font-size: 30px;">I'm Going Walking</span>

This I call "Precious Walking"

The goal is to get exercise and be social.

1.)    
Be healthier and wealthier, wiser and smarter, and happier and richer.
Inviting kindred spirits to spend time together socializing.
Doesn't cost any money.
The rule is to use good judgement, and best effort, for civil and respect.


2.)   
Precious Walking can be called 'Before After Work Social Time'.
Meeting times for Precious Walking can be daily.
Precious Walking time meets at the starting point and departs promptly.
The distance can be 1 mile or 3 miles.
Your mileage may vary.
Which town map to choose, is which is closest for these particular walkers. 


3.)    
But a trait of Precious Walking is, groups can cross over. 
So group sparked from work colleagues can invite family members walking too. 
Group sparked from next-door neighbors can invite work colleagues too.


4.)
A trait of Precious Walking is, lots of people can attend.
For example, work colleagues, family, neighbor, kids, dogs, friends, retired folks, and more.
Acquaintances and strangers may want to join in.
Be ready for some very real socializing, and do use good judgement.

  
5.)
A distinctive trait about Precious Walking, is that it is held in a neutral zone.
A turf that is slightly removed but still close.
It's a public forum.
It means that people are meeting together, but at the same time each is still independent.
On the sidewalk or equivalent, that represents public free space.


6.)
Which time to choose, envisioned is before work or after work. 
Example for morning then (6:00am or 6:30am).
Example for night then (7:30pm or 8:00pm).
Your time may vary.

SPECIAL NOTE i.)
A distinctive thing about Precious Walking is, it needs selling.
It doesn't cost money, but it still needs selling.
And the more I try to convince people to attend Precious Walking, the more I learn.
Lucky for me, it will be easy for me to 'sell' since I truly believe it really is valuable.
So the special note is that for those like me who are promoting and leading Precious Walking, the real value is in getting exercise, being social, and also learning to sell.
• Get exercise, means walking.
• Be social, means talking.
• Learn to sell, means keeping the group going. (No money changes hands, it's not that kind of selling.)
