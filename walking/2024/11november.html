<span style="font-size: 30px;">I'm Going Walking</span>

I'm going walking around town.

I call this "Precious Walking"
  
The goal is to get exercise and be social, in other words, is to be healthier and wealthier, wiser and smarter, and happier and richer.

This time is precious because I invite kindred spirits to spend time together socializing, and also it doesn't cost any money so it conserves our life energy.

The main rule for Precious Walking is good judgement, and best effort, for civil and respect.

Sometimes I call Precious Walking 'Before After Work Social Time'.

Meeting times for Precious Walking are 6am and 8pm, meeting at the starting point, and walking for a mile or three.
